No seriously 😐 😒 😑 😕 🙃 😪 😐 😒 😑 it's so good Spanish or vanish,5
Bro wheres my family,1
Good,5
And more and more ads. Lately it's been more like woke and LGBT propaganda.,1
Suck.,1
All I'd okay but what happened to it's profile pic 😭😭,5

Duo's bro got his reboot card,5
This app is realy very interesting,3
The bird is alive?!!!!,5
Why is duolingo bird deaddddddd (Edit: the bird is backkkkkkkkkk),5
He's live?,5
fun just super fun but dou might threaten you because that if you don't do your Spanish lessons you vanish and it's official.Duolingo made a literal song about it called Spanish or vanish (it's a literal meme),4
"Now you can't even practice for a heart. Thanks for the sparky ads, but if I wanted to pay i would use a proper language service and not this game",1
Why did you limited the option to regain hearts by practicing,1
"I don't think I made an inappropriate comment. You had errors in the system and I also lost a facebook account registered on gmail in 2018 because of you. ""Long and frequent breaks are the key to great success."" - Romanian proverb",3
Good..... Not bad....,3
Awesome.......,5
I love it 💞💞💞,5
"Quả nhiều quảng cáo , app giáo dục mà toàn quảng cáo rác như tra tấn người học, bọn tham tiền mất dạy. Đáp án thì không dịch ra nghĩa tiếng Việt thì sao học được cụm từ vựng, toàn phải trên bên app khác, quá thất vọng cách dạy kiểu này.",1
Oh my god I love you Duo I love your app so much😍😘🙏💋🙌💖💜💖❤️♥️💕💞Love you,5
So Beautiful app and so helpful,5
The math part is really hard to balance the number. But still great app,4
"Ah, Duolingo—the linguistic dungeon ruled by a psychotic green owl. It bombards you with nonsense like “The ducks are reading the newspaper” while butchering grammar and logic alike. Miss a lesson? The owl knows. It haunts your phone, guilt-tripping you like a Victorian aunt. Learning? Hardly. It’s a bizarre endurance test in frustration. A real scholar would abandon this neon-green tyranny for a book, a tutor, and the sweet silence of an owl-free life.",1
I love it😎,5

I am having so much fun on duolingo it's teaching me math and things and it's so much fun,5
"Don't waste your time or money on this app, the only way to learn now is to pay. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HEARTS WHEN YOU COULD PRACTICE TO FILL THEM UP. They don't care about what you have to say, your complaints etc, so saying you don't like something won't matter. Their customer service doesn't exist.",1
Why so many ads? :(,1

"They've been focusing more on the dopamine provoking side than actually learning something. It's not a bad experience, but not sustainable in the long run. Learning languages by using them is still the best thing you can do.",3

"Duolingo has become a ubiquitous name in language learning, and for good reason. Its gamified approach, accessibility, and wide range of languages have made it a popular choice for millions seeking to broaden their linguistic horizons. However, like any educational tool, Duolingo has its strengths and weaknesses, which are important to consider when evaluating its effectiveness. One of Duolingo's most significant advantages is its gamification. Turning language learning into a game.",5
this help me learn every word in Spanish thanks Duolingo i love Duolingo it is the best ever i just love it thanks Duolingo hope you have fun doing Duolingo.,5
This app is fantastic 😍😊,5
"I learnt many korean letters but I want to know more,,this app is so helpfull to learn all languages🎀",4
one the best app,5
Teaching the same thing if I get it correct,3
"In Ukrainian I am told the accent is not very good. Teaches you ridiculous things. Who needs to say ""no that's not my elephant"" Brilliant at forming a habit though and promoting competitive learning which works for me",4
so far it is easy enough to understand and retain especially due to repititions of even the same words,5
great learning platform,5
Nice app and interesting,5
Children good suggestion platfo rm,5
"not bad, should givr it a try",4
"Since last year update I can't use the app, it keeps saying ""offline"" even when I'm online. I uninstalled and reinstalled it and I have missed classes for months. I'm just installing it now again. Same issue",1
little bit expensive to get the ad free/unlimited lives version but still definitely worth the cost,4
I am so proud of you,4

I recommend all beginers,2
I learn in this app Korean and Hindi now I want to learn Marathi and English but I also know hindi and marathi but I know half of Marathi but don't everything I don't know Korea Japanese but I want to write the full languages a very important very very important app I love you so so much thank you Duolingo to support me and to know the Korean and Hindi thank you 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄,5
bestest,5
duolingo reached me to speak Japanese,5
"Good for something that is free. The ads are getting bad. I liked the first version MUCH better than what has developed. Sometimes, they don't translate the answer, it just says whether it's correct or not. There's not much learning in that. One of the guys voices irritates me so bad I have to turn the volume down when he talks. Taking away the practice to earn hearts function was a mistake, how are we meant to learn if we can't make mistakes? Lose five hearts and you're done? Stupid.",3
I really like the simplicity of it. Super easy to get started.,5
You are best duolingo,5
Duo Widget is very dramatic. App has lots of features and makes it fun to learn. My German has improved so much since using Duolingo,5
"I used to LOVE Duo Lingo lessons. I have at least 12 languages I've started learning bits and pieces of. I love so much about the app, the speaking lessons, the listening lessons... ...but I honestly can't tolerate how Co-Dependent their Duo Mascot is on the Home Screen Widget. It's actually making me feel too depressed to do Duo Lingo lessons because Duo gets SO depressed when I am going through life that keeps me apart from the app. Please cheer up Duo. Nectar attracts more Bees than Vinegar",2
"Generally a good app to learn languages with. Sadly the options for non-english speakers are very limited so if your english isn't good enough to learn a new language based on it, you might not be able to learn the language you want. The ads are okayish by now.",4
"This app is a lot better when it comes to learning about languages than Google translate ever will be. keep up the good work, Duo!",5
very nice 👌 👍 👏,5
Helped me so much,5
very important,5
"It's really useful for cross country vacations and stuff if you want to have more fun but it's not like fluency it's like being able to do the essentials like order food somewhere and stuff and I also like the little app icon changes if you dont practice they're pretty funny and clever. Overall this app is useful, fun to use and a lot more positive things.",5
its good 👍,5
it is so fun,5
love it,5
"it teaches in a nice slow relaxed way, so you learn at your own pace.",4
this app is very helpfull,4
This app changes its icon to harass people,1
"very good, they literally made learning fun and way easier",5
this app is good for every student,5
It s a good learning app but I don't t expect that Duolingo will collaborate with squid games ☠️💀,5
I have learned so much from this app! I hope I can finally speak to my grandparents in polish so they can understand me! Update: I can now speak to my grandparents pretty fluently thank you!!,5

"I didn't know it was really working until I heard the language being spoken in front of me... even after a long break from practicing. The time I DID put in was worth every bit. When I experienced this, the first thing I did was jump back on and start practicing again. I'm very impressed.",5
I love Duolingo this app teach me so much things.,5
it's great for learning some words,5
best language learning app😊,4
I really love duolingo and how it lets you learn very well. Although what confuses me is how it gives access to fictional languages like elvish for example but not languages like tagalog (ive wanted to learn tagalog for a while) and i cant on duolingo. Id love if Duolingo does eventually give access to more languages like Tagalog. When that happens i will absolutely use it more,3
very good❤❤,5

It's a good app to learn language.,5
"I don't appreciate how the translations are inaccurate. While studying Japanese and doing the word match exercise, I came across ""うみ"" and it was matched to ""beach"". Totally wrong. Even if the phrase ""うみにいきます"" (which is the example sentence used) can have the implied meaning of ""going to the beach"", it literally means ""going to the sea"". ""うみ"" means ""sea"". ""はま"" means ""beach"". Come on, guys. Also, ""あめ"" means ""rain"", not ""rainy"". Will more of this kind of misinformation crop up later?",2
nice,5
great app,4
"You can not learn the essential grammar in Russian or any language for which, you'll not understand when the word changes accordingly and will fail over and over again. Bring grammar.",1
duolingo is amazing I have learned so much from this app,5

"I appreciate this app because it provides fantastic lesson. Start now to use it, you will never regret",5

good learning app,5
it's making learning seems too easy and interesting,5
Great.....nothing upper then🫡👍👍,5
"Let's be honest, it's all about the money : subsciptions. The teaching content and quality has changed over time - not that it was great before, but it was there if one looked - no more grammar tips or explanations, no more comment section or discussion boards. At the free entry level one is obliged to look elsewhere for help and explanations.",2
I love this app.This is so useful.🤗😊,5
So sweet good game,5
Mujhe Korean sikhana bahut pasand haiisase ham log bahut Sare language just Sikh sakte hainaur yah bahut Achcha app haiaur isse to five star hi Hona chahie,5
"I would prefer to just study on my own without being in a competition each week with other students. The promotion and demotion system used by Duolingo is not for me. I often feel I do exercises to earn points rather than to learn the language. Duolingo has many positive features, but the completion system app developers have instituted is not to my liking.",4
this app is very helpful for learning English,4
I am so interested. I hope I will learn English through these duo apps,5

"having a great time learning Spanish, a trip out of the country reignited my spirit to be a linguist and. Duolingo has been fantastic, I will say the free version with lives and having to wait to continue after making unavoidable mistakes because your learning. Can be discouraging however they gave me a free trial to start and I've found it to be worth it if I'm willing to commit the time and learn. all said good app maybe I'll come back and write another in Spanish when I've learned it",5

You can learn a lot if you stick to it.,5

"Honestly, it's really good. The only problem is that when im speaking, I literally yell words, and duolingo won't get it! It's so frustrating, and I literally got a 43 in my lesson, I didn't have any background noise, and it was sooooo annoying! Duolingo, PLEASE fix this.",4
such a great app for learning many languages,5
"I've used Duolingo to sharpen up my Japanese for over a year. It has been an invaluable tool to bring me back up to an acceptable level of Japanese speaking, reading, and some writing. Now I am venturing into Spanish as well.",5
"this used to be a 5/5 app. They took away so many features like the community chat, and they stuffed it with adds that it made it less of a tool and more of a cash grab.",2
it's really good app's to learn language,5
it's so super app to learn languages,5
Revolutionary app!....... BUT: I wish they would allow people to choose either a Streak Score or an Accumulative Score for people who dont need to be opening the app every day. I pay for DuoLingo+! I should have the right to choose to skip however long I want and just earn days when I use the app.,4
Definitely would recommend if you are looking to learn new languages,5
good,5
"Duo did NOT force me to write a good review. 😌 They are very sweet, and I'm actually getting really good with my Spanish. I'm also in competition with my little sister so it's nice that we can both see each others progress.",5

The only thing that's I didn't like was that you can't learn māori (New Zealand language) but learning other languages is fun and challenging at the same time.,4
My only complaint is the commercials. However I can't complain because I am opting out of purchasing the upgrade. This is a fun way of learning a new language. My daughter and I are encouraging each other. Bueno,4
We can learn very easily using our phone,4
it's a good way to learn a different language it helped me learn Spanish.,5

"Duolingo is the perfect app to learn different languages and is fun you can add friends and family .There are so many languages to learn this includes math, music, Arabic, Spanish and so much more this app makes learning more languages fun and not too hard. I personally like Duolingo because barely any adds and fun I normally don't give apps 5 Stars or write long reviews if you're want or need to learn another language I prefer Duolingo.",5
good,5
osm 👍,3
An easy way to learn a new language.,5
I love it it a lot !!!!!! A BIG QUESTION??: why did this application had spread a lot of fear in everyone who are using it? Youtubers had all creating videos to avoid the app by saying It is dangerous. And one thing that the steak. If missed a day it keep on messaging and neglect the user by irritating messages. It always keeps main eye on streaks and challenges but not in language procedure.,4
Excellent in regular use.,5
duolingo app is very good for schools Student,5
Great app you should make it possible to chat with other people in your streaks like texting,4
better than some of the more popular apps I've used,5
It's kind of fun,5
I like duo,5
"it's is perfect for language, reading, and writing",5
Really helpful!!!,4
is helpful.,5
"the best app,, learn to english",5
The Best 🫡😎,5
"Deeply frustrating at times. There are questions where the hints given are incorrect, which does not help with learning the right translation at all. It also doesn't help that the rules of grammar don't get explained, so I never quite know why a word is or isn't supposed to be in a particular place in a sentence. I'm learning, but I feel like I'm not understanding.",3
"People may think that Duolingo is bad, but it's really not when you learn languages it's a new thing and on Duolingo you have something to work for like the Monthly challenges that you have to do and the leaderboard I mean this is probably my favorite language app out there. Thanks Duolingo! Especially you Duo.",5
The Extra points earned do NOT always add on to my points. said I gained 25 xp points and they do not add on to my points. sometimes the points add on and many times they do not.,5
Duolingo is my perfect learning platform,5
very good👍,5
very useful 👍,5
"Every update gamifies the app. Expect the same exact sentences, over and over again. This used be a decent app but now there are 2 paid tiers, the first one just lets you make as many mistakes as you want and the second one uses ai. This is not the app to learn a language with. Don't waste your time or money.",1
nice 👍,5
work app good 😊👍,5
a learning language apps at it best,5
جميل جدا,5
good,4
this is the best app to learn any language 💯🎖️,5
I started with the free thing but ended up buying a family subscription. so far we're all really enjoying it. it's only been two weeks but we can say little things now. give us a few months and we'll have lots to say in Spanish,5
Best learning app ❤️❤️❤️,5
They make it to hard unless you pay,1
love this app. definitely recommend using a language textbook to accompany your journey,5
great 👍,5
I'm learning something,5
It's a good app when you download but when you go to uninstall and unsubscribe the emails continue to come through which can be annoying and frustrating,3
"I had a great time using Duo with a streak of over 1100 days, and a couple of years before that. Tried the paid version, but the limitations of the free version helped me to learn. A recent change now means that as a free user, you no longer receive explanations of why your answer is wrong, nor do you have the ability to freely practice previously learned grammar and vocabulary. Duo is no longer a free learning app. The free version has been reduced to being a trial for the paid version",1
really really nice it helps me in Japanese and can teach you any language you can learn it for fun too.,5
useful to learn!,5
this is amazing app dont know why I didn't start sooner,5
I have learned faster than I expected. I am learning Japanese and I thought it would get too complicated when it came to learning the characters but I can read and write any hirigana and I have learned a lot of Kanji. It's a very engaging app and a clever methodology. I look forward to increasing my skills and in time taking on another language.,5
good,5

"A few weeks into learning Japanese. It's getting a bit tough and exciting. And I hope I don't have to update this review in the future. But Duolingo has done a good job keeping me focused so far. It's been a busy few weeks but the gamification with the day wise streaks and simple quests every day, I'm managing to eek out a few minutes even on my busiest days just to stay consistent. All in all - so far so good. Let's hope I'm conversationally fluent - at least passably - by some time next year.",5
"very interesting, nice tutoring 😁",5
Duolingo is the best,5
it is Soo good,5
very excellent 👌👌👍,4
very good classss,5
ai sucks for actually learning language. 2021 and before Duolingo was so much better,1
Duolingo is very smart study in game,5
Auto hard refill will increase the number of readers and also give a lot of pleasure to read. So it would have been better if the auto hard refill was done dear Duolingo member. Thank You,2
"Hello I personally love duolingo because if you want to lean languages...THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU!And you can kean more than one language and lean fast and easy by breaking down words,characters, or signs!I'm learning Korean and I've been on this app for 6 days and I'm already half way through section 2,nationalitys!So if you want to lean a language try Duolingo!",4
the app offers all the necessary language learning techniques,5
Make it easy for me to learn other languages.. forever learning with Duolingo!,5
very Good,5
very super app,5
farther the streaks the more grammar they provide,4
this is very great 👏aap i love it ❤,5
"It used to be fun and had me looking forward to each lesson. However, the latest update (late 2022) is absolutely horrendous! The CEO is being given feedback, but he has openly said he's NOT going to change anything back! He's definitely NOT listening to the longtime users. This is not good! Duolingo used to champion user comments, but it doesn't look like they do anymore. Change it back! UPDATE: It's hard to finish Quest, when some of the lessons don't load! I've tried others devices.",3
I love it because I learned so mush French and so did my mom,5
"This is the most Funniest, Fun, and Most Entertaining app ever. It also challenges you and you probably like challenges and there are contests too.",5
best English teacher,5
very good to the language skills,5
it so easy I stay on my streak thank to the developer for making the app,5
I Love how this helps me get to learn Chinese (DON'T COME FOR ME BUT I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT MY STREAK!!!!!!),4
love it,5
it makes learning fun.,5
5 star rating,5
this game is helpful,5
"So far I'm enjoying the german language course. unfortunately, I feel harassed by the application. If you purchase Duolingo Pro, instead of seeing ads for other things they force you to see ads for Duolingo Max and it's just as annoying. Also there's no way of turning on the streak tracking and the league scoring which are extremely annoying to have to sit through. Will not repurchase the Pro in future years.",3
very cool to learn,5
"Don't enjoy that you have hearts, but other than that It is a good app.",4
Very slow app technical issues too much time wast in opening.(i buy full premium but app shows continuously adds i want to hate duo but I'm addicted by my course till 2021),1
super,5
very good an i learned about japanes e very well thanks duolingo😉😉,5
"Some answer buttons are not work it's irritating 😔 please chage it , it's didn't allow to move next level",1
good for learn new languange.,5
the hearts system is annoying,3
"podrían añadir un botón que sea para aclarar dudas o explicar algo nuevamente mientras se hace la lección, por ejemplo , yo no entendí por qué iba el ""do"" en las preguntas, y tuve que buscar por otros medios para aclarar la duda, pero, con un botón (por ejemplo [!]) que sirva para aclarar dudas, hubiese entendido mejor y más rápido.",4
parfect game 😍😍😍😍😜😜😜,5
The best to learn all languages,5
really good for learning small words and nice to remember,5
cold and hot,5
amazing,5

it's so good,5
"The app is trash, better to use it on web with ad blocker. Constantly bombarding you with Super Duolingo ads after every session. Money hungry mr Duo.",1
learn more,5
I JUST GET MAD WHEN I LOSE A HEART BUT I LOVE THIS LEARNING APP,4
very nice 👍,5
"Quite fun and Competitive.. But actually, It's too fun, I have no idea How to really understand each sentences use for daily life situation, It's like I have to learn a lot of it So I can take a step further with so much vocabulary I need to work on.. Overall, It's really Good",5
a wonderful app,5

Great learning platform if you're willing to give a little time.,5
honestly a great way to get into rhythm!!!,5
the speaking option isn't working. There is not enough explanation of when and how to use the different forms of words.,3
easy to learn and animations are cute 😀,5

love your site. Duolingo is fantastic!,4
"Edit: Removed 2 stars because app is glitchy. Hard to move to next lesson because the screen blanks out. Leaderboard results blank out and when pressing a word in Word Bank, the word doesn't go to the top line, it falls by the green Checked button. Please fix asap. Easy to use. Fun to learn. Keeps you motivated to learn and practice each day with interactive game like features to keep you interested in learning. Love it. Gracias!",3
some of the direct translations are a bit off but still a great way to learn another language!,4
I learned so much by this app,5
I'm doing well. helping a lot,4
very nice,5

"it's great for learning English, it improves my english faster than I learn in school. A very useful app!",5
i lub duolingo ɛ:,5
it invigorates the mind.,5
"suka banget sama apk inii, bener² membantu dan belajar gaperlu bayar",5
id have to say it is enjoyable but i have a nitpick and its the lack of other slavic languages particularly serbian if u guys could possibly include this with the app that be great plz address this thank you.,4
"Nice for learning basics, but I keep getting kicked out of speaking exercises, and the leader board won't load, so I can't see my position or do the match madness and ramp up challenges. Not a very well maintained app overall. Some of these nudges are really rude, too.",3
grate learning app what I have seen. I learn every day 15 minutes per day at least.,5
"It's good for starters. If you do one lesson a day just to keep your streak, it takes a while to complete one level. It's very repetitive. You just practice the same words and only learn like 4-5 new words each level. Also, the reminders are very annoying. Every week or two, even if you don't continue your streak, you get a reminder. And if you do, it reminds you every day 1-3 times. Overall, it's good for learning basic words and phrases unless you're willing to do it for a very long time.",3
I love duolingo cause it teaches you how to speak a language,5
"After you complete a lesson, a big ad pops up, and you can't close out of it. The only way out, is to completely close the app, and start over. Please fix this! It's so frustrating!",2
I love it it's helps me learn Spanish I wish u could learn the Cambodia language,5
teaches a lot. I mean a lot try.,5
perfect application,5
👍,5
this aap is very useful,4
I LOVE IT,5
too many adverts,2

"Recently I experienced a bug and didn't get fixed, and made me lose my one week streak.",1
it helps me learn different languages,5
I Wana learn Korean tell I'm 19 or 18 because I Wana move to Korea right now I'm 15 and This app helps so much I'm learning a lot and it doesn't make it difficult to learn you better try it,4
It's easier than I thought to learn French,5
"it's helped me learn Japanese, and I love it",5
Duolingo has been both enjoyable and informative! It's helped me keep up with my Spanish!,5
"Doulingo is an WONERFUL app that helps me speak and communicate with other Spanish people! ¿¿¿Hola, cómo estás???",5
"Before the last update, you could practice to earn back hearts but that option has been removed. It defeats the purpose of being a learning app when a learning tool is being replaced by a cash grab. Please return the practice option!",1
this is a BIG opportunity to learn something new and this is such a really fun thing to do,5
sweet,5
Very simple app to navigate. The lessons are clear and offer many helpful tools to learn. It's actually made so that it's fun to learn a new language. I am currently learning two languages simultaneously at my own pace.,5
it is pretty good,5
so fun ❤️,5
it is a nice app,5
I love it,5
I LOVE THIS GAME,4
"not bad, very challenging!",4
I honestly Love Duolingo because it makes it super fun learning new languages and encourages you every time you reach a milestone not only that but it actually teaches you the full languages it gives you lessons of listening reading and writing I did also teaches you mathematics and more not only that but super Duolingo is very convenient for people because it provides the best I definitely recommend this game if you are looking to learn a new language,5
"amazing, fun, easy to follow, to engage with and dynamic... well done Duolingo team!",5
it's alright,4
this is a good way to be teached differnet langues around a the world!I recommed.,5
"Outstanding app to learn any language, brush up on a language and gain deeper depth into appreciating one. Thank you!",5
Awesome,5
I love it 😀 😍,5
Great 👍,5
Very good app,5
"Listen here buckaroo, stop giving me words you didn't teach me!! I am STRUGGLING over here, and I had one more thing thing to complete my lesson to get my streak, and I accidentally closed out, and NOW IT RESTARTED",1
"Awful, you only get reminded 2 days before your free trial ends, no additional heads up atleast a few hours before it ends. The notifications are pretty useless as it doesn't show you on the app either. I've just been charged 60 pounds for being one day late to cancelling. How to end the trial is really unclear aswell. I'm disappointed.",1
"it's easy, fun, and motivating when you learn your languages!",5
very good experience...but too much pub,5
I have to give this app a five star rating because I don't wanna get on Duo's bad side,5
"amazing,not explanation #1 learning app ever",5
veryyyy good,5
مفيد جدا 💓,5
Duolingo is an app that makes language learning interesting. You can be sure to gain a lot from this app,5
"This app is amazing for language learning I have done French so well because of Duolingo like I have done so well in Spanish,German,Music and Math and more.Never lost a day.",5
good fun I first found it when I wanted to learn polish,5
I didn't like the style of learning where you're plunged into quizzes before being given notes but actually? It's not bad.,5
"very good and fun app to learn a language. though keep in mind, this won't make you fluent.",5
Nice,4
Really easy & enjoyable way to learn or practice a language. The social aspect makes it a fun experience.,5
"I really like this app, and it will help me learn different languages for fun. Right now, I am learning Korean. I just need to do my lessons on time.....I would rate it 4.5, but I can't, or I just don't know how😑",4
"7 year streak, I'm essentially married to this app now. But I can speak to my in laws because of it!",5
pretty fun,4
That's awesome,5
"Need to add Filipino, otherwise a great app",5
best!,5
really enjoying this app and helping with me learning welsh,5
perfect I just love it it's good for all of the languages. you want to learn,5
Very very helpful,5
So fun my kid learned so much from it now she can speak just like use we speak Spanish she can say mucho custo,5
Duolingo is the best French app every 🥰 love you,5
It's getting worse and worse. - It's telling you that you have earned double XP but will not give it to you. - I have probably finished Italian lessons as it's not coming up with anything new and it only allows me 6 It lessons in 24 hrs. - And in Spanish.. There is that where I have to fill 3 verbs but it's blocking the 3rd one and the only option is to quit game. - I have a huge list but I am only allowed to write under 500 characters. Concluzion: I stopped recommending it. It's a waste of time,1
"I have to watch just under two and a half minutes of adverts for every exercise I complete. Thats no incentive to come back every day. I know youre trying to get me to pay for the app and take out the adds, but this is ridiculous",1
Very helpful... 👍🏾,5
Interesting,4
"You can't spam lessons one after another, because the XP will NOT count towards the leaderboards. Had x3 XP, so I was able to do at LEAST 7 lessons equalling to over 300 XP only to find I was only counted for 110 XP. Please look into this. It's a little disheartening.",3
Awesome app i recommend it,5
i learned over 10 spanish words in twenty minutes... thats crazy bro,5
"app doing it's best to make me learn 😂,, tq duolingo developers",5
music is very fun and it's good for education,5
muito bom.. melhor aplicativo de inglês,5
Great for beginners!,5
"i like it, but i cant say it about being fun",4
it really worth my time 😀,5
nice Duolingo family,5
Duo is like a friend🥰.Helps you learn step by step.I took one of those said to be hard languages but am doing pretty great🥳.Am impressed.I can't really afford the premium one yet but imma make an effort to for sure😉.,5
"A really put-together app for learning, I recommend.",5
"Its the absolute best learning game ever you guys have to download it,it's literally so amazing👍🏾❤️",5
It's the best language app I have ever used,4
I llove the frozen streaks.,5
I'm actually kind of sad about this AP's changes. The features for learning and the hearts are just not cool. The inability to learn on a free app sucks. You can't keep your streaks if you fail even though you're logged in it acts like you didn't do a lesson. Failed lessons is STILL logging in and trying. Totally uncool.,1
Excellent Language Platform 👌,5
because i love it,5
It's almost impossible to study with this application due to the many ads. Also every time you make a single mistake and you have no hearts left you are taken back to practice for a heart. The worst application ever!! Unbelievable!,1
it helps me Arabic so I can talk Arab to my crush Samira,5
"This app is great! It's thorough with the lessons, simple to use, enjoyable and fun! I also like how if you answer a question wrong it will explain why (in the paid version when trials are offered)!",5
"Duolingo rocks. it makes learning a language very fun, and the competitive elements keeps me engaged",5
IT IS FAN-TASTIC I LOVE IT. ITS SO GOOD,5
"Great, but i have a problem with the leaderboard. suddenly it doesn't load . it has been going on for a week now",4
very helpful 👌,4
French has 8 sections close to 150 units. Portuguese which is very similar has 4 sections and closer to 50 units. I have premium. Maybe worth it. I started off non paid years ago and even though they cap you at 5 mistakes a day it was still doable but you probably won't be progressing on the higher leaderboards. Unpaid version has ads that are WAY TOO Loud esp w/ headphones (which they recommend). The load times for lessons are a bit lengthy. They double Paywalled a mistake explanation section.,4
I can learn polish 🇵🇱!,5
nice app to try out. it does teach and easy to follow the instructions,5
"it's a good app, no glitches. The only thing I would say is that losing heart makes me mad sometimes, but it also makes it addicting and you can always get unlimited version",5
👍,5
Hello I forgot cancel my subscribe can you canceled my subscribe please,5
it's really fun when I downloaded this i new russin like boom!,5
Very fun to learn with my daughter loves it and loves keeping her streaks. It does keep repeating the same way to teach new words.,4
it's great I'm really enjoying learning language with this app,5
"awesome، fine, best revision,",5
its really helping app to boost up my fluence in English . i am still practicing this daily .. wow. ita marvelous .. keep it up ...,5
it's a great way to increase your vocabulary and understand basic grammar concepts,4
a ten out of ten! I almost lost my streak in resulting in my family getting kidnapped by Duolingo.,5
nice app,4
"Duo was 5 stars but ever since the Feb. 2025 update, you can not practice (old lessons) to regain hearts in the base game (free version). Hence I've lowered my review to 1 star. It will remain that way until the company decides to undo their update.",1
Perfect 😘,5
I have been using duo on and off since it was still a fully free app. I currently pay for plus and am frustrated. The speaking componant of the app has not been working for over a month. I've sent countless error reports and multiple emails to tech support with no response. It's hard to justify paying for something that used to be free many years ago when it's not working and I am receiving no assistance. It's a bummer becuase I have learned a lot.,3
good 👍🏻,5
"It's fun, alright. Then, it becomes very discouraging when you earn just a quarter of the points you've earned(90 but get 20 points) 👎👎👎👎",2
good,4
Es ist sehr gut und es hat mir auch geholfen jetzt französisch zu lernen ich kann es euch nur empfehlen.,4
The app has gone so much worse. Each and every update makes it worse as a free user.,1
This is the best app for learning new language. I love everything about the app,5
wonderful app I like how it makes you speak it after the third lesson in each language,5
"I love it it's so fun,easy, and engaging for me to learn not only languages but also math and music! There's one thing I wanna ad to it which is the language in the Philippines 🇵🇭 I hope we can add it I'll love it.😊🤩",5
good application,5
"it's such a good app for learning new languages, music, and even maths. I really love this app I have recommended it to so many friends and we have battles to see who can get the highest streak.(I am winning btw with a streak of 103 days) Me and my friends can rate this app soo highly trust me it's such a good app. If you wanna battle your friends in streaks try this instead of Snapchat streaks and plus you learn at the same time. Thank u",5
nice app,5
wonderful teacher i love you duolingo,5
good,4
very nice pace to learn a new language we'll designed app,5
"There is no rhyme or reason for how the languages work. Some have phonetical ways to help you, others you are on your own. The way some words are spoken to you do not reflect on how they are priperly announced, at least not enough for the app to pick up on what it is you are saying. The only reason it gets the 2 stars is being free. This app is very limited though and you will have to find other means of learning later on",2
Very good at teaching languages across the globe 🌎 5 ⭐,5
"I like the superduolingo thing ,but i think that everyone should have it for free. Great app tho🩷",5
Double stacking ads might be the most annoying thing this app could ever have.,1
"very good, I just need duo to upgrade the avatars options, thx",5
I'm loving it so far!!,5
I wish I could show you screenshots to let you know about something wrong,5
I love it and if I'm mad I can just learn German,5
wonderful app teaches wonderful learning skills and you can practice for sometime even when offline Truly wonderful,5
the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
best recommend😇,5
"The only complaints I have are: so many ads, omg! I lose interest in using the app when I have to sit through 4+ ads after each lesson, and the lessons are super short. I can do a lesson in less time than the ads run. AND: Don't guilt trip and degrade me into practicing. Ugh, I hate that. Rude. Have an option or something to choose how you coax us into practicing. Your characters are terrible. Yuck. You could use some options there too. I don't want some rude girl as a teacher, etc.",5
"Esta bien la app porque puedes aprender hasta miles de idiomas y eso me gusta, yo practique inglés desde hace 2 meses y ya se mucho el ingles.",5
diventa un pó noiosa dopo un certo punto imparare una lingua.. gli esercizi dovrebbero essere più stimolanti. Mi piace la parte della musica però anche se la tastiera virtuale non è come quella fisica,3
Good but sometimes its langweilig,3
like this game,5
the best app ever,5
very helpfull danke shion,5
great lessons for beginners,5
"I helps a lot in helping you study your desired language , get this app now",5

it is a good and fun game and u learn to,5
Great app!,5
you are so cool duolingo because of you i can now speak Japanese thank you Duolingo 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚,5
"I like this app alot because the Ted talk that I heard about it , made me feel homely and true sincerity here , but I didn't like that it too tried to sell a subscription but huh that's just my own stupidity , ofc everybody needs to make money",5
This app is not for urdu speaking person. How ridiculous. I am very disappointed,1
too much Duolingo max advertising,4
"this app is amazing, I'm currently learning French, and my streak is on fire. I'm learning new words, how to pronounce and d say them in sentences. I totally recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn a new language, I feel like they should kinda put more african languages bcz the only south african language there is Zulu what about the other 10(it's 11 plus sign language but im not sure if that counts) but overall it's a very good app",5
bombastic 🎉,5
Great way to learn another language while having fun,5
amazing,5
"polish language: excellent for review and repetition. poor in vocab introduction ... start with nominative examples then move to other examples. also, not much explanation of reason for spelling/case usage. need other resources to fill in gaps.",3

Very good helps me lern French 🍟 write the world down 👇 and write how you pronounce white the English word then write the other language word use Google translate for extra help do it for a year and you should master whatever language you're learning 1 billion out a billion stars for Google translate And Duolingo if you're learning a new language read this comment and this should help you learn a new language.,5
es bueno,4
good,5
can't practice to get lives back,3
its really good for me,5
"Really annoying to use, constantly loses your rewards so you lose all you've worked for. I'm paying for this app so others can have it for free, it should at least work properly. My kids stopped using it because they find it so irritating.",2
best app ever,5
Nice,5
"Very irritating to find you can't get past a request to pay. The next time it happens, I'll revert to my BBC French course & delete Duolingo.",1

this app is very useful and helpfull..... I like this app,5
too much helpful,4
"Generally, I don't like the app. I will continue using it, but it's not good. The ads placing is designed to make you pay for no ads. Also, they really only let you do lessons unless you pay for more. It's not good for learning an entire language and lies about stuff a lot. It is designed to make you click to pay. An example of a lie is that when you run out of hearts, it tells you to refill for 450 diamonds. But when you go out of the lesson and click on your hearts, it says to refill for 350.",1
superb,5
I can learn high vilarian here it is so cool,5

very nice,5
very versatile very good,5
to expensive for me to do a monthly subscription. if you have the money it seems decent. if they taught a language for a set price even if it only lasted 5 years would work better.,3
"Duolingo is very helpful well I am trying to learn French! It challenges me, but not so hard that I can't do it! I can also pick meany different leagues to learn. Duolingo also saprots me and reminds me to keep up with my daily streak!!!! Definitely recamend it!",5
Nice app,5
অসাধারণ 😍,5
Gorgeous!,5
عالی من دارم فرانسوی یاد میگیرم,5
Brilliant app,5
"look duolingo is amazing but i haven't been able to load a lesson for three days now and since nobody else has had this problem my streak has been ruined and moved down a league also i don't appreciate the limited number of lives per day, even if it's ""beneficial to learning"" or ""you have to make a profit somehow""",1

Really nice and useful app. I am leaning English with this.,5
It's really helpful for me. help me to learn Chinese and English faster than I ever imagined,5
"This application is good for enriching the one's vocabulary and pronunciation.However it's demotivating sometimes when you're trying to reach a high XP points to advance in the next leagues,(I got to the finals of diamond stage level and when I started doing my courses I found that I was eliminated despite advancing as top 7 in the semifinals) The glitches and the app errors makes it counterproductive in addition of the limited hearts that is no longer available for you to earn 5 full hearts.",2
It's really good,4
this is a great app to use for home school,5
it is a really good game to learn I have learned a lots of things,5
Nice app,5
enjoying ♥️♥️,5
good app 👍 and I increase my language skills you are trying this app 🗣️,5
"The best learning app there is ,I have learnt over 4 languages with this.Thank you to the makers of Duolingo.",5
I do like duolingo but there are some issues. I paid for the year of base version. You really only get extra lives and no ads. My biggest issue is they hardly explain anything. Many things don't make sense without at least a basic explanation. You'll realize when you make a mistake it has a link to explain the mistake but you have to pay for the max version. No discount (that I'm seeing) even though I've already bought the base. You would think basic explanations would be included at least.,3
Best,4
"it was very good,!",5
really it's very useful but I want Malayalam language 😢,5
this application is very good please add Urdu language in application this is very helpful for us,5
it's really helps to improve out knwledge💯,5

my favorite app 🙃 and my english teacher 🤷‍♂️ apps notification is my fully focus in the practice 😊,5
nice,5
"great for helping to learn language, only duolingo related ads-skippable after like 5/10 seconds-rarely get ads though! takes things slow, has reminders of past things you learned, i find it amazing, far better than other language apps, free! turns what would be boring, hard work into a fun game with stories and interactable games in between. has daily streaks-friend streaks too! help s with speech aswell as words/word order!!",5
🥰🥰,5
Duolingo is very interesting and good for learning many languages and I'm hare learning english 🥰😄😊,5

this blea,1
"it's a fun way to learn another language so far. I have noticed you kind of have to figure out what each word means but then they hammer it into repetition. also considering the language i speak and the one I'm attempting to learn are both germanic, it's fairly easy to figure out, however some kind of lessons or initial hey this is the word we're focusing on and what it means, could be helpful for other languages that are nothing alike.",5
Very good app! It's easy to learn any language in this app.,5
verygood for people,5
kafi acha application h esse english sikhne me mddd milti h,5
"I used to love this app and I am in diamond league with 500+ days but this app is really starting to disappoint me as I can't even use practice to earn hearts unless i have used all 5 and even so can only get 1 which doesn't make sense provided we r learning a whole new language, The feature was not only useful to get hearts but also practice as it asked questions i have learnt already, It is just becoming more unfriendly to unpaid user with more features being removed and bugs added!!!!!!",1
"🎀♥I liked it to an indescribable degree, I loved me, teaching me beautiful things and benefiting from it a lot",5
Cool way to motivate people to learn.,5
It's great as always ❤. Love you Duo. ✨,4

it boosted my education in school,5
The Good: Spanish to CEFR B2 - Amazing! Recently increased the Comprehensible Input for the courses. Wish all the common languages were at the same level. The Bad: it seems that every update tries to squeeze more money out of the users. Being a free user is frustrating and difficult intentionally. Also so many glitches and bugs. Always something new. XP credit errors (says you get 60 XP...gives you 10) is the most frustrating!,4
its good,5
So good for learning language,5
"This app is highly recommended for English learners of all levels, It's truly one of the best.",5
Helps me to improve my language skills,5

it helps alot and I learned alot from this app. I haven't experienced any problems with it,5

Effective and helpful!,5
u can make it more interesting or enjoying😊 just make it more creative.,5
very useful to learn any language,5
Endless ads which distract from learning. it would be a useful app otherwise. I find a quit using it after a few days after trying again out of sheer annoyance.,3
it's good but there is only one week free rest is paid Duolingo please try not to take a paid after a week if the person wants to learn he/she will learn but what if they can't give money to the aap .You should think about poor people please try to understand,2
good for easy learning 👌 👍,4
This app is very helpful for learning different various language i personally love this app,5
interesting 😁💚🦉,5
Generally is ok but every so often some lessons with really gross errors pop out Edit: The structure of the lessons are not well schemmed and the learning methods are poorly thought out at best. Best case scenario you use it to learn some useful phrases and some vocabulary. You vaguely grasp a solid grammar concept,2

I've been learning German and I have been so into it! The stories were funny especially ""To the railway Station"". While learning in the app, you shouldn't miss a day or some lessons! If you do, Duo will kidnap your parents, some of your family members or even your whole family!(Joke!).",5

"I'm learning Japanese and often the audio is incorrect (using a ""hu"" sound for what is meant to be ""fu"") or not letting me type the correct letters and then marking it wrong saying ""try writing it like this"" with incorrect letters (specifically づ which is pronounced ""zu"" on the app, but it recommended I type it as ""du""; or ""ぢ pronounced ""ji"" but recommending I write""di"") It would also be great when learning how to introduce myself if I could use my name instead of ""Naomi"" or ""Hannah"" every time.",3
it's mind-blowing... outstanding,5

Just wow,5
thanks for free 🆓🆓🆓🆓 and easy fun language class it's awesome👍👏😊😊😊😊,5
amazing 💯💯,5
"This app is very good! Great... I love it. Just a little bit suggestion... Some languages seems didnt get enough attention, make them hardly to be studied. I hope you could pay attention to them and make them more useful than now, i study arabic and latin but the sound isnt that good and i still hardly understand daily conversations in Arabic even though i have finished study it there.",5
❤❤❤,5
I can't see intermediate English option and many other options.,1
I like it,5
this Duolingo is nice,5
This app is good to learn new words . Does who knew basic english should apply for intermediate english 👏,4

"It keeps getting stuck on the same lesson, I repeat it with no mistakes but it will not allow me to continue. The other downside is it only has Brazilian Portuguese not European Portuguese. The lessons are well thought out and when it works it's very good.",3
this app is good for basic learner,4
a bit repeat the exercises,4
you should not add characters in this app instead of characters you can add pencil paper etc.. and the sound when we complete a task in a row is too bad you should delete it.it will better without any music there otherwise app is good.,4
"This is best app for learning english,☺️☺️👌🏻👌🏻🎉🎉🎊😊🌞 best ever very very very very very very good app",5
The best,5
very nice,5
"The app was pretty oke, all the UI and the lesson are beautiful. But, the problem here is no tablet support. I don't say iOS, but tablet version of Duolingo it just quite not there, I am an owner of Oppo Pad 2 and when I launch Duolingo. It just strip down into the mobile version instead, soo. I hope the developer see this feedback and added support for good experience and also good learning /// Love Duolingo, thank you ( 112 streaks because of you )",3

Too many ads and unnecessary animation and fewer options on the setting,1
"The interface of this app is very colourful and fun, i learn it from daily basis whenever I have free time. You can learn so many things without even realising.",5
good,4
"It's a amazing app for learning a new language, however, the circle on the lower cased form of ю when it comes to the alphabet spelling, must be pixel perfect or something, because I have failed it at least 25 times, I've never really had any issues with it other than that.",4
👍,5
"Pretty good, main issue is the ""Choose from these few options"" Style, I feel it takes away from the memorization a little but that might just h me",4
Really interactive and fun,5

super 💜,5
"They should also increase the time for super duolingo the 3 days free thing to five days. I can't make any progress within 3 days. And it is not a good way to advertise. And I think the freeze for streak, there should be more not only 2. Also they need to teach numbers first in some languages. Not only that, now they have disabled the part where it says practice to earn hearts. Pls consider this. 🙏🏽",4
best way of teaching thanks Duolingo 😚,4
this is a very good app i am learning korean frim india,5

super and good 👍,5
"there are a lot of mistakes in both languages, but I can say for sure in the language of the learners. and I don't need to learn how to spell peoples names, that's ridiculous",3
"A great tool to supplement the learning process (formal knowledge of, for example, verb tenses should come from elsewhere). You can do Duo lessons at your own pace, which prevents stress!",5
i love this app,5
perfecto,5
this app is very nice,5
it's really interesting and I like very much this app,5
It's bad cuz I can't add more word sometimes or something went wrong,2

the best app to learn any language 👌 🙌 👏,5
Very nice language learning app superb,5
super,5
"Why does it feel like I've been tested on the same 15 to 20 words ""you're about to forget"" for the last 2 months? It's getting very boring and seems wasteful and pointless. Something wrong with the algorithm?",3
love it it is amazing I am going to learn Chinese so easily it has colourful things and I focus more this is absolutely amazing I love it so much,5
The quality of the courses varies greatly. There are quite some bugs to deal with.,2
"OKish app, but I find having to write and spell correctly somewhat difficult and unnecessary, when all I want to do is have a simple conversation in Polish. Also finding I can talk about an old fish and other random stuff, when I havent been introduced to everyday words and phrases - ie hello, goodbye, please and thank you. Even knowing how to count would be more productive than what I am learning. Not worth the 50 odd quid a year.",3
very well 👏,5
"Great, the audio has some issues where it didn't heard what I said many times over especially in the specific audio lessons. No problem in the regular lessons though with the audio",4
I think that this aap is so awesome to improve english skills,5
"Could be better, still Amazing",4

wonderful app,4
great game for learning,5
wow,5
I don't want duolingo sad,5
They are consistently unable to have the audio match the correct reading of kanji in the Japanese course. Even the audio for the question and answer to the same problem won't be consistent. Like listening problems will constantly have different audio for the answer.,1
amazing 😍,5
good,5
"Okay,i rated it 5 stars can you let me out of your basement now ,duo?",5
i love this app its so easy to learn new Language!!,5
it is so much fun learning every language I really appreciate doulingo,5
"A pp thinks I'm China based, so it stuck with +86 country prefix. Not sure how to let Duo know that I'm Australian and have never been to China. Some languages have limited learning models, e,g Finnish",1
"Duolingo needs learning units on structured grammer (e.g., tenses such as ""present"", ""present progressive"", ""past"", etc.).",3
i have really liked this app it's so easy for me to learn the languages 🥰,5
great 👍😃 good 👍😊,5
"really good and easy to use, but some of the pronunciation is slightly off (learning Hindi)",4
very nice app 👍,5
Very useful,5
"I selected the intermediate level in English, but I ran into an issue. Every time I reach the listening test, no matter how many times I tap or how high I turn up the volume, I can't hear anything. At first, I thought it was just my phone, but the same thing happened on my sister’s phone too",2
American translation not British. Sometimes really annoying. Wish there was a proper English version for the UK. Otherwise very good.,4
"Love it, veryy useful and simple👍",5
There is not english language option that's why i deleted this app otherwise it is nice,3
very very important app,5
good app i like it ❤️,5
Duolingo is the best for you and your language 🌎 just by listening and doing it they have a YouTube channel to so please,5
I have learned so much in the past few days. I recommend Duo,5
The best app to learn everything,5
add thai language,1
best app for English learning and speaking,5
"Overall solid learning. However, the practice sentences are FAR too repetitive. There's only so many times you can practice the EXACT the sentence. The app does a good job of incorporating prev. vocab into new lessons. However forced flash card review is too frequent without a way to skip over known words. The free version would be amazing IF it wasn't so clogged with ads. The basic subacription primarily just eliminates ads. The premium sub's AI features are great but the monthly fee is INSANE.",3
"Muy buena app, sirve mucho para no perder práctica y aprender nuevas palabras en un idioma en mi caso ingles, si quieres aprender un idioma al 100 tienes que combinar esta app con otros métodos pero igual me a servido mucho para aprender inglés, es muy útil 5 estrellas sin duda.",5
I love this app I can learn easily English to speak read,5
I have used this app for many years My girlfriend is also using your app learning (American) English I am surprised you haven't got around teaching UK English there are many differences.,5
good,4
great!,5

Best app,5
excellent app,5
"I LOVE DUOLINGO. IT HELPS ME TO STUDY LANGUAGE WHEN I HAVE TIME, BUT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT I SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY LESSONS.",5

"The app says there is music and math, but when I install it, there is no music and math, this means, this app does not update at all",1
very nice and good aap,5
good app,3
"The app is good at encouraging continual use and repetition in order to learn a language. However, it teaches very little grammar and focuses heavily on learning a language by ""sight-words."" This prohibits further understanding and discourages circumlocution to try and say what you want. Yes, it won't be proper grammar, but the person you are talking to will understand.",2
Very easy and fun in learning,5
"hallo, ist bin jerett, I Love this",5
"Fun and easy way to learn a new language, I recommend 100.",5

This aap is good but the heart loss system doesn't make any sense because if we do mistake they just take our heart and then we are not able to play further....so I'm just telling that we will do mistake because its our first time,2
I like this app,5
thank you duo,5
good,4
"I'm enjoying now, because there is one person who motivates hehe. But this app is good, it helps you a lot. I will give it a 5 star its free and you will learn different kinds of language that you want to learn.",5

"So far it's only teaching me the clean stuff. It only tells me how to say good things about people, for example. I think this is great to start, but I may need to learn critical language elsewhere.",4
This app is very helpful for people.we can't pay money and enjoy the language what do you want 💕😀,5

मस्त है पर music में indroduction हिंदी में भी रहना चाहिए और इंग्लिश कोर्स को और बढ़ाना चाहिए मेरा 40days में खत्म हो गया।,4

best app for learning languages,5
Easy to lern English and very nice app,5
great app for learning .. but at times gets too competitive and the app bugs get to your nerves.,4
Duolingo is to good application its helps to me lean different languages,5
"The app used to let you discuss or find explanations for language rules by leaving or reading comments in a discussion board. However, a while back they got rid of it. Now when you don't understand something, you have to pay to have it explained.",2
Nice duolingo aap is very interested,5
very good,4
I give this rating because who is going to learn Spanish when the sentence doesn't make any sense. Example : The cow opened a chocolate box and many more of these absurd sentences.,1
this app is very useful and totally free,5

It helps me how to speak other languages.,5
its really nice for english learning,5
good good good excellent,5
very good,5
"My duolingo doesn't have audio. At first, it worked well with audio and all. Now, there's something wrong with the audio because, no matter the language, there's no sound, and it's a pretty huge problem when you are learning a new language.",3
It help me a lot with Japanese,5
very nice app,5
A good app but sometimes prone to glitches such as you doing an exercise and not getting your points.,4
good,1
"Enjoyable to learn both listening, writing & speaking. Very POOR support. Virtually nothing in the app or online site. I have had no capability to follow someone or have them follow me. Sorry But I'm not paying $12.99 a month for half working app",1
"in the effort to force you to subscribe and pay, the new way you can't earn hearts to continue is really demotivating to learning.",3
nice app for school I like it,5

it is so a helpful now I know zulu,5
Duolingo is helping me learn German and I've only been doing it for three months but I've gotten pretty good I would recommend if you are try to learn a language and don't know where to start,4
BEST ILER SBB BOLE TOLONG AKU STUDY SUBJECT FRANCE AKU HAHAHAA 🥰,5
good,3
Honestly seeing this owl get so emotional keeps me going,5
it's very helpful 👍,5
great for learning and highly recommend you turn on the little reminder pop up,5
"good 👍👍😊 but some issues like adds, subscription.",3
I find it's easier to passively learn a language using Duolingo rather than studying from a book.,3
I love it,5
good Duolingo,5
this is very cool ..❤️🙌,5
i happy for duolingo app english words sentence end essy method,5
this is a very nice app we can learn anything,5
great,4
Duolingo took my wife and kids...I don't have long left before it's me next.,5
Duolingo is excellent for learning a language at your own pace. It uses different types of exercises to make the lessons interesting and fun. Frequent repetition helps increase vocabulary and embeds the grammar rules in the learner's memory. Currently I'm simultaneously learning two languages using Duolingo.,5
Gud,5
Fun and surprisingly effective way to learn a language.,5
I'm giving 1 star for not being able to see my podiums,1
very useful app,5
great,5
The best app for learning and I enjoy to learn Japanese,5
very well built application thanks 👍,5
this is really very interesting and learning app ... everyone should install this app for learning and enjoying English 💜🙋🏻‍♀️,5
very nice,5
needs less adds,3
Kinda good but I hate it when they stop making notifs . KEEP SENDING NOTIFS SO I WONT FROGET DUOLIGO,4
very good. Nice session,5
muy Buena se las recomiendo tiene lecciones muy interactivas y excelentes 👌,5
It helps me learn how to learn more about. Spanish..,5
I love this app.,5
good,5
too many ads,1
thank you is very useful app,5

The reward system is glitched. Not accurate.,1
Good,3
i love this amazing and energizing app.,5
Fabulous app,5
excellent app,5
very useful to improve skills,5
IT WAS ASKING WHAT MY HOUSE LOOKED LIKE,1
very useful,5
Best helpful app,5
"Please fix your ads. Your ads are disgusting. Take into account who sponsors you. I like your language learning features, and at the moment I can't afford pro, but I might just stop using Duolingo altogether if this isn't fixed. I don't want mature ads. I don't need or want those things in my mind. Thank you. Please fix it, and I will be inclined to increase my rating again, since this is my only but biggest concern.",1
this app is really good it teaches you step by step,5
fantastic 😊,5
"Enjoyable and teaches you basically everything you could learn before actually speaking with the native people. However, the heart system sucks so bad. They recently made the ""practice to earn hearts"" function premium only. This is absolute garbage and should still be available to unpaid users! Or maybe set the hearts to refill faster? Either way this limitation is ridiculous. Also faar too many ads, I watch 2 ads per lesson, I spend more time viewing ads than actually learning...",1
good,5
"Too many ads, some of which you can't get out of without shutting off the program. Quite often they use new words or give you sentences with no translation so you don't know what happened. They should have a channel that builds vocabulary without more and more confusing tenses",4
"Great/fun app. My only issue is they combine super/max users with non-paid subscription users on the Leaderboard, so the paid subscribers have an unfair advantage. If you are motivated by competition, it can be frustrating. I am sure this is a tactic to promote their subscription service, but my daughter lost interest in the app as the weeks went by.",4
very good learning aap I love it ♥️🤓,5
Bahut achha app hai 👌 💫,4
this is a really good app I learned alot on my trips to France and Canada duolingo really helps and is really simple and makes learning a new language really fun!,5
"Tbh massive money grab, limits learning experience with hearts and doesn't even explain why you were wrong unless you pay a monthly fee. You're better off wasting away in school for this than using this app.",1
Fun learning,5
"excelente app para aprender el idioma que quieras,es interactiva y lo mejor de todo, es gratis",4
"1. Kids lose focus every now and then and are eager to just keep adding new courses rather than focusing on the current one. Duolingo needs parental control features where we can hide/disable the add course button. 2. There should be feature to restart a unit for revision. 3. The Japanese lessons are full of mistakes especially with ichi, ni, san. 4. Lessons are either too repetitive or too full of new words, there needs to a balance.",3
very good aap learn to English,4
this application is very helpful but it needs more development in graphics,4
so good 😊,5
nice,5
Duo be mine for valentine,5
good 👍,5
Duolingo literally uses their gems for inflation even tho its hard everything is pro and max and you have to wait for hours to get a heart and and there is no points for hearts if your learning so much ads even duolingo's ads itself comes built in with it for some reason and if your on your last report you can't even report the question if it has a bug and the new update makes it to get one heart and you can't get more and you have to wait for an hr ppl are trying to learn Trash app don't get it,1
Very Useful Application for improve English language with Enjoy..,4
"Why after you finish a lesson you have to watch a ad is just not fun. Out of all of that is just good so I rate it 4stars, ok, the ""wake up duo with a lesson!"" Is just too funny and why? That's rude",5
great,5
must app hai,5
intresting and joyful to learn...it Actually supports for learning other languages. ☺️,5
It's a fabulous way to learn! The exercises are created in a conversational style so it's not imposing grammatical rules and verb conjunction like other language schools do.,5
best app for learning english,4
bien,5
"Really enjoying duolingo and I think it's actually improving my grasp on Spanish. I've heard that folks often use Duolingo in conjunction with another learning tool, but so far I'm just using it on its own. The competitive aspect definitely motivates me to keep up. (I have the paid version.) Update 2/2025: have had some issues with not receiving the correct amount of XP even when in ""triple xp"" mode, or even ""double xp"" mode. I restart the app but it doesn't always fix the problem.",4
super 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Duolingo👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
good 😊,5
this is the very helpful aap for learning and speaking english.so I am happy from this app😊,5
best app,5
"Duo makes it fun to learn! Also, I like that we start out learning helpful words and phrases right away.",5
great for learning the fundamentals,5
I really like duo and it fun learning new languages,5
"It's awesome, but now you can't gain more hearts when they run out. They should had left up that option.",3
i love it 😻😻😻😻😻😻,5
"I have a 622 day streak, Duo has helped me a lot in learning Spanish. It's easy once you actually try, and I don't even have Super Duolingo or Max!",5
Having an issue with the scoring. Just keeps going three dots without any scores???????? Please fix it.,3
I've enjoyed the challenge of learning Italian.,5
good if you want go somewhere else,5
Very fun way to learn a language. Got addicted and do many lessons a day. Highly recommend,5
it really can help you learn the language,5
"Duolingo always wait me to comeback, thankyou",5
🥰🥰🥰,5
Very good app💗,5
I hate Duoling,1
feels like a gatcha game without the gatcha,5
amazing.,5
good for Filipinos,5
Excelente app para aprender inglés,5
Great for learning!,5
"Sweet app, owls are great ways to keep learning new skills.",5
I've used Duolingo off and on for a couple years now. and I have to say they've got it figured out! (I'm learning Spanish) the conversations that you can listen to and then it will ask you in English what they were talking about to make sure you are connecting and comprehending is AWESOME! I don't normally post app reviews but that aspect alone blew my mind!,5
Very good for learning languages and math! 5 stars for service.,5
great,5
"There's to many ads, I didn't mind when it was just duolingo, but now the ads are brain rot. Duolingo has slowly been downgrading. Please get rid of the ads you baddie 🙏🏽",2
Good for learning new a skill,5
This app is so good!,5
weldone,5
It's scary I never did my Spanish lesson Help???,1
It's easy for learning about fun 😊,5
nice,5
Chinese course doesn't recognize any of my pronunciation,2
it is best to learning language to go to travel,5
thanks so much,5
Favorite language learning app I always recommend to others!,5
He took my family when I didn't do the lessons 😭😭😭😭,4
good use,5
Congratulations,5
this is a greet app for learning languages,4
Got better at math!!,5
Application good,5
Nice 👍,5
This app is Perfect for beginners!,5
First I have to say that this app helps you learn a different language by a lot also keep up on your streak because he will blow up your phone with notifications you should also get the widget because the pictures Duolingo put on it is funny. Anyway get the app and follow Duolingo on TikTok (If you didn't delete it),5
"The app works well. I've learned a good bit of German using the app, and it has good features for the pro version. The basic version is too limited to really get much out of it, and it's a shame that it's cut so short just to upsell the premium version. The ranking and competition system is kind of gimmicky, and the topmost ranks are just bot accounts anyway. My biggest hangup is all of the random sentences and mentions of gay/LGBT type content. Kids don't need to see that when using Duolingo.",3
Good,5
"very good, but has ads unless you pay",4
"Great way to learn language, 5 out of 5!",5
This is very helpful if you want to learn any language. And I have been using Duolingo for 21 days,5
it is very very good for learning I like it very much if you want to go somewhere and don't know language so this is best and guiders are also pretty good,5
it's such a good app,5
I'm so disgusted with the changes which have resulted in my spending far less time learning each day. I don't do Lengendarys anymore because I'm too fearful of losing hearts now that I can't recapture them by doing review lessons - which also reinforces comprehension. I feel like Duolingo has become a money grab and I am no longer benefitting from this app as I have over the last few years. Looking at other options.,3
Awesome 😎,5
this is soooooooooooo funny I learn a lot of Spanish,5
ok,2
Endless technical problems and NO technical support!!!,1
great,5
it's helped me so much with my journey of learning korean!! 안녕하세요 어떻게 지내세요,5
"Very few countries are given to Bangladeshis, it is very sad",2
because i can learn every language like korea thank you doulingo,5
super,2
sometimes answers aren't right and I wish it would give me a breakdown of tenses so I could see the patterns,4
"I really enjoyed this app and upgraded to the yearly subscription but up until recently, my account lost all my progress from all my languages and I was logged into some random persons account with a different name, email, etc. and when I try to log back into my account, they said my account can't be found....",2
really good I appreciate for it,5
it's sooooooooooooooooo good,5
"You guys help me learn so much, thank you!",5
it's amazing app really 👌🏻💚,5
Yep this is better then any learning app I love how being friends with people it's very fun!!!,5
"The app is really good for learning languages, I've mastered basic German quite easily by learning in this app. My only complaint is there's too few languages for learning. I hope the development team adds more languages for us to learn.",5
I LOVE IT THANKS FOR TEACHING ME INTERMEDIATE ENGLISH🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️,5
It's good but cannot learn more things in same time.,4
help me learn new languages in an allergy and I have to do my Duolingo so I really like Duolingo,5
"Update 9Feb25: App keeps getting ""stuck"" when accounting for completed lessons. I've done 8 already and it keeps saying I've only completed 3. This has been going on for at least a month. Super annoying. ----------------------------------- 3Feb23 Love it. Easy to use. Listening and speaking exercises are great.",3
thanks very useful my life for english,4
the best,5
It's Good and Nice,5
like it,5
very useful app learning to all languages,5
So fun this app is like a teacher learning other languages and I'll give this a 5 stars duo cute,5
brilliant,5
This is a very good app use it i am learning a lot of new things from this every day! Ty Duolingo,5
perfect app for learning new languages 🤍,5
"I'm getting ther,",4
ti amo duolingo gracias por enseñarme.,5
"In the past week, I can't access the leader board, or either of the alternating games hosted there. Please fix it.",4
Very fun learning game,5
because I learned any word,5
Love it!,5
"Provides no instruction on pronunciation or how to handle gendered languages (such as french). It expects you to repeat phrases with no prior practice. It expects you to know you need to use ""une"" instead of ""un"" when referring to a woman with no explanation as to why or what was wrong with your answer. I gave up on using this app to learn French because it doesn't seem geared towards learning a language, just quizzing you on things you already know about a language.",2
helping me learn German fast and easy,5
is a very good learning game.👌🥰,4
this game is amazing. I love learning korean,5
fun learning japanese with Duolingo,5
"100% works,I recommend people to try it.",5
the biggest downside is learning alot about American cities. I live in Canada and will probably never say the name of these cities outside this app. I'd rather learn many random cities then just American cities. BTW not an issue in learning French as much as it is in learning Korea otherwise duolingo makes learning fun and easy.,4
Good it awsome to learn all languages gracias duo,5
Fun way to learn espanol!,5
love. it's interactive and fun,5
with Duolingo is pretty good but pretty bad like a little bit at the same time,4
it's a fun app. I've really learnt a lot of Japanese using this app.,4
learning another language is not usually fun for most people but somehow this makes it pretty fun. My wife and I compete against each other and even bought the upgraded version to get rid of the ads because with the ads it was practically unbearable,5
love this so much,5
super 👍,4
"I'm old enough to remember back when Duolingo was truly free, without any catches or paid features. But it's still excellent as a free app. Thank you 🙏🏿",5
I am getting stuck repeating the same lesson over and over cuz the 3rd drop box in verb conjugations disappears and doesn't allow me to fill in the other sections. The screen locks up and doesn't let me go forward or back it ONLY let's you Quit! which makes you loose all your progress...this happened so much I wanted to rage quit :(,3
AI driven garbage,1
It's a five star for me I'm beginning to pick up real good on Spanish and I'm learning it for free Sounds too good to be true But guess what it's true 😂 I advise you download it,5
I learn so much,5
"Fun, but glitchy and inaccurate. The listening feature is very spotty and sometimes doesn't hear you or register at all, causing you to error on the exercise and ruin any chances at a perfect lesson. Sometimes restarting the app fixes it. Once that feature is improved on, I'd have nothing to complain about. :)",2
it good and great I almost better a russian,5
I complained that my app still seems offline and nothing has been done about it 😔😕 Kindly check that for me,5
This app is the best way for learning new languages,5
Know what really takes the wind out of your sails when trying to learn a new language? 2 minute ads after one lesson.,2
"It is no longer possible to fill up hearts with practice. Only when out of hearts it is possible to do one practice. That is soooo anoying. Also bugs dont get fixed and new ones apear frequently. Very bad experience, this app is sadly declining a lot.",1
wunderbar,5
Helps me to improve my spainish skills!!,5
thebest program,5
"Duolingo needs a 1 cause they deleted my 72 streak and I don't have a lot of gems to get it back. And I am tired of getting so many ads and I need to pay so much gems just to repair my stupid streak like 700 or 2000 is way to much gems and now I cannot get my streak back. AND I CAN'T UNINSTALL THE GAME!! ALSO I HAD 1003 GEMS AND THEN I ACCIDENTALLY CLICKED MORE HEARTS AND NOW I HAVE 658 GEMS!!! DUOLING SHOULD HAVE A ""are you sure?"" BUTTON SO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME DON'T GIVE A BAD REVIEW!!",1
"very fun to learn languages with duoling,Don't skip your duolingo tho...",5
this is the best app for learning languages it very flexible and easy to understand,5
really perfect application for learning I am learning a hard really language but doulingo made me really know them and learn them well!! thank you so much doulingo,5
I like the style of learning and you can dedicate just a few minutes at a time.,5
awesome arrangement of activities.,5
very nice,5
تحفهه بجدد,5
I learned a lot. Aprendí mucho.,5
Do I have to explain? The app is just amazing!! ✨✨💚💚,5
Great app HOWEVER are the leagues necessary! I love this app and think it has been fantastic in teaching so many people other there who want to learn new language in a fun interactive way BUT does it really have to be based on leagues. As a full time working mom of 5 kids as you can imagine I'm juggling a huge amount of tasks and duolingo is my downtime but I find the leagues disappointing as they add pressure that I do not need added to my life when I just want to have fun and learn.,3
بجد بجد برنامج هائل جدآ و ساعدني كتير جدآ في شغلي,5
"Very good and useful app. Some more variety in words and numbers, plus more practical phrases would improve this.",4
it's a great app! makes learning a new language super fun!,5
"So far so good, Duolingo is turning out to be one of the best free/paid apps on playstore. wondering how come it took me so long to try out Duolingo for learning a new language. love the well broken down bytesized lessons for every level of expertise. To the Dev team.....keep it going👌🏽",5
a great tool to broaden your horizons. surprisingly effective for how easy to use it is. I wish I had used it sooner,5
The advertising takes up 50% of the time.,1
"Love this app, been using it for over 3y now, it's cool to keep a language in mind everyday, but please please please hear me out, add croatian to this app, I love this language but I'm stuck with almost no app who's doing croatian, and switching on two different types of app is not interesting.. Please Duolingo team add croatian!!!",5
doesn't have Mongolian,3
"Give XP boost sometimes, but they don't really have varied answers good app tho",4
very easy to navigate and learn from. I'm enjoying the Chinese language,5
Fun and easy to learn languages 😁,4
"A great app with choice of languages ta choose. Brilliant! Yet somehow insisting ""App not connected to Google Play"". Wonder what is going on?",5
"You show words before you tell they mean. You use unnecessary places like London or Philadelphia - it would be better to use Venice or Florence in your examples. You give the ""option"" of buying extra minutes or levels - and if you refuse to buy them, you shut down. It could be a whole lot better.",2
"Instead of a language learning aide, duolingo has turned into a toy app with insiduous monetization tactics. Not recommendable at all anymore.",1
diese App ist perfect 🤩🤩👌,5
poop 💩,1
the best I like it,5
it helps me learn my favorite language and I all ready know a lot like une graçon et une chat(a boy and a cat),5
You're making it so simple than I thought,5
I like that I can spend just a few minutes per day studying Spanish and make good progress.,5
niice,5
very gud,5
"used free trial of super duolingo, and even though I shouldn't be penalised for not continuing with it after the free trial as advised, I can't refill my hearts with a practice run. Shame on you for lying.",1
"The frequent problem of the app getting stuck on a black screen when going to an ad is annoying! There is no way to go back, I have to end the app or restart my phone. Additionally, the scoreboard has issues not loading frequently. It would be better if it weren't so buggy!",2
so entertaining,5
Great Apk,5
"Doulingo is a very learning app, when I started it was quite boring so I tried other apps and guess what I came back to doulingo cuz I didn't really enjoy it. So I suggest who so ever reading this to download doulingo cuz it's the best app you'll experience.",5
never get extra points when it says I've got double and triple points just single points,2
relly good for learning all ages,5
Gracia amigos. However that audios are not properly functioning.,3
it is really amazing and really good for fast learning,4
This app is great!,4
Continually marking answers wrong when they are gramatically correct. Words are misspelled. Ads all the time. 5hrs to replenish one heart?! This app has turned into cash grab.,1
تطبيق جميل ويستطيع ان يأسسك بنسبة كبيرة,5
very interesting to learn here. I encourage others to do same,5
"An expensive way to learn if you pay monthly, have to be very serious to pay, but it's fun but doesn't actually teach a lot. It does not help you much with vocabulary and learning the verbs. (Repetitive words) Unfortunately too, it is made in United States so everything is Americanised. Pants (trousers)",3
It provides as many options as possible for languages and mistakes. It also makes you feel eager and motivates you.,5
"Don't waste your money on Duolingo Max, the AI video call is rubbish and it's the same conversation every time. It's glitchy and sometimes have to try 3 times to get it working. If you try to ask ""Lili"" any questions or have a different conversation it doesn’t work. It's no good for learning a language to travel. I'm racing through the lessons and we have only just learnt numbers up to 10? and very few useful phrases that you would actually need travelling.",2
"Like a fun game you play every day after work, except you're literally becoming bilingual in the process 😂",5
Good learning game I'm really learning French,5
"I love Doulingo 💜 💜💜 I get to learn languages like Japanese, Dutch, Hawaiian, Swahili! I also do the music and math and it's sooo fun!",5
I'm learning so much! I'm excited to speak Spanish with someone.,5
Good,5
amazzzzzinggg♥️♥️♥️👍,5
Love it,5
I love this app,5
very good for new learners,5
it help me learn a lot,5
its a really especial app with a lot abilities.,5
"The more I use this app, the more I am frustrated. It hangs, shows black area instead of an image, it sometimes awfully slow, it presses too much for getting XP, it is not smart enough in many ways: the word hints often irrelevant, it doesn't recognize many types of typos, it doesn't consider that many users are not native English speakers. Etc, etc. It regularly steals XPs that I earn with blood, sweet, and tiers😬",1
it nice and easy to learn,5
I love Duolingo because there're a lot of languages that we can learn and I well like to learn France and it really helps me🦉💚💌,5
The most fun and educational game at the same time. It teaches you every day how to speak English skillfully and fluently and nourishes your vocabulary through fun.,5
"bisakah kalian membuat opsi absen belajar sementara? aku sedang sakit, tapi aku juga harus menjaga runtunan belajar bahasa inggrisku, melihat ponsel membuat kepalaku semakin sakit",4
very interesting,5
Used to be a fun way to learn foreign languages. Now they sell so much stuff it feels like I'm at a timeshare pitch. Probably moving on when current subscription is up.,1
I really like it because it make me more learn English,5
I love this app it helps me learn a lot of words phrases and more,5
excellent,5
it's a great app even if you're trying to learn complicated languages like I am trying to learn Korean and right now I'm super good downloaded it's good,5
so fun and easy,5
i can't believe it's working,5

Top app for learning a bit of every language,5
it's ok,4
very nice one just go for it,5
just amazing I am learning fluent Spanish,5
Great app that'd very useful. However the animations are excessive and the regular vibrations infuriating.,4
"This app used to be good, but has been absolutely ruined by the recent change that stops you practicing to regain hearts. I didn’t mind watching a few adds to use it, but no way am I subscribing to get unlimited hearts so after 565 days and stuck on one exercise for 5 days, I'm done with it.",1
it is so cute I want to play it every day,5
exelent coursoa,5

"it really punishes you for not paying for a subscription. you get 5 ""lifes"" and for I to replenish it takes 1 hour for each ""life"". if you do nothing all day that's not a huge deal but people who have busy days and only have so much free time it really screws you over.",1
it's very good app,5
this is super nice and good because it's helping me learn languages and it has streaks on how many days have you been learning so I love it and it's super helpful.,5
so far Duolingo app is enticing since it gives all the rooted words of any language one would like to know. I love it ❣️❣️,4

Good easy to understand,5

"I like the app, I own the yearly subscription, and make my relatives learn the languages hustle free.",5
"Very simple and helpful tool. incorporates reading, speaking and writing. Great app.",5
"Very great app! You can do any language + music and math if you want! The downfall is if you run out of hearts you have to wait 5 hours, but still a great app!",4
"This is a great app yet after recent update, it's impossible to track the list of other users on this app. Please fix it asap. Thank you",2
"I give it 5 stars because it has been teaching me the Language I want to learn other apps didn't do that. it dose ask you Questions, but it's really nothing personal. Unlike other apps and that's why I like it. And I love the little The little owl Duolingo They sell plushees of the lil green owl",5
it's wonderful app to learn languages,5
muy bueno me encanta,5

thanks duo,5
هذا التطبيق رااإع💯🔥 😲!WoW!😲!واااو!😲,3
"very enjoyable, easy to learn from dou",5
"It's a fun and interactive way to learn Spanish and German. I had given DUOLINGO more stars previously. However, there is no assistance on Duolingo Max when learning Polish. Needing an extra explanation for Polish was the reason that I purchased Max, since Polish is a different language to learn. This is where assistance is needed. More support results in more stars",2
Good,5
super,4
"Very help full application, I am preparing myself for Germany. It helps me much to learn german language.",4
The best language learning app that I know of. 👍,5
this application is very good 😊👍,4
fantastic,5
Would rather use ai than pay for humans. Disgusting.,1
This makes me happy because I can learn many languages that I want to learn for free. I sometimes even unlock super Duolingo for free for around 3 days and can add my friend to it and I won't be charged. I like Duolingo. :D,5
love this app!,5
great app for learning another language and readdressing words learnt helps to retain them,5
super duper pehle shurwat me samjh nahi aya tha but ek hi din me sab samjha chuki hu thank you Duolingo chidiya and I love you 😘😘 5 star toh banta h beshak,5
yas bahut achha lag raha h,1
"so far, so good.",5

What makes Duolingo particularly remarkable is its user-friendly design, which caters to a broad spectrum of learners, ranging from complete beginners to those seeking to refine their skills in a language they are already familiar with.

"I think this app is very well structured, as well as the lessons and the pace at which they allow me to learn. I also enjoy the encouragement that it provides and the opportunity to correct those mistakes with a reward for doing so. By being able to correct them, I am able to learn more easily from those mistakes so as to not repeat them again. I recommend this app to anyone who desires to learn another language no matter their reasons or intentions.",5

"The new ""awards"" are a serious let down 😞 !!! 1) I was looking forward to finishing the old ones and I hate having to start over. But much more importantly 2) You get almost no feedback to tell you how you are doing. For example I have no idea how close I am to the next ""Mistake Mechanic"" level! There really needs to be a counter on the badge so you can tell! Please fix this!",2

Solid,5
"Loving the app so far, great user and experience and interface. Great work devs..🤝.",5
i would love if Duolingo had basque but the actual learning is great.,5
"It's more of a game than a language learning app. There is a lot of potential with Duolingo, but the flaws and gameifacation ruins it. I'm on the Japanese course, and it's not been a good experience. Most of the speakers talk too fast, even with the slowed down option. Also, when you are asked to repeat things (which doesn't start until too far in, imo) you are not given enough time to read and speak. It will cut you off and mark you wrong. Migaku and Renshuu beats the pants off of Duolingo.",2
SO Amazing,5
Heart system is so dumb,2
great for beginners,5
Very good app thanks to had maden this helped me in learning Japanese language,5

"Great app for learning vocab. Useless for learning grammar. It could easily be improved by putting more information in words hints (gender, declension, etc) The 'guides' to each section are completely useless.

💖,4
"It is a straight forward, easy to use app for practicing foreign languages.",5
too much add,2
"Great program, keeps you motivated. Ad's can be frustrating when you first start but they seem to ease off once you get into it.",4
"For every update, they continue to make the app worse.",1
good,5
Very helpful app,4
"The counter is wrong,always cheating...for example if it's supposed to add 30 exper.it only adds 10,or just a lesser random number.PLEASE CAN YOU FIX THIS?",4

Duolingo is a good app where you can learn languages that you wanna learn and even more you could learn how to play a piano and how to solve maths,5

Duolingo is always bashing me hahahaha🤣😭😭😭😂😂 but I love this,5
it's asome,5
Best ever,5
i really enjoy the time I spent on Duolingo,5
Great app to learn. The one thing is hearts are not enough and we lose them in words that we dont know before( that id my opinion),4
Good app for learning eng👍👍,5
I hate the fact that you HAVE to pay for this game. I had a 400 plus day streak but 5 hearts aren't getting me past a day. Change your game.,1

this is amazing. I always wanted to learn Spanish but I can only learn it when I'm in college but thanks to this app I don't need to wait for college or online classes I can learn at home. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.,5
it can help u with any language and math and English skills,5
"It's because if you don't have subscription you get only 4 chances to do wrong if you do more mistakes you can't learn the language and also if you don't have subscription you can only learn the language content can't do it for more time, can't do much mistakes and also there are many other things in the one with subscription... So just give us unlimited hearts we want nothing more please Duolingo please.__ Just scroll the reviews down and you will know that some have given only 1 star.",3
fun to do and helps me with learning!,5
l like it but not really because if we get a question wrong we have to gain a heart,3

good app,5
"i am getting extremely annoyed by my exercises suddenly being given only 10 points for whatever reason, so my 3x boost combined with the 2x boost gives me only 40 points instead of 120, even though it shows 105 base points at the beginning, and it still goes on for however long the boost is supposed to last. 45 minutes today. This all happens the last day of tournament finale. Fix it, fast.",2
"No Lithuanian. They have freaking Clingon and Elven and whatever, and no Lithuanian.",1

wow amazing,5
niccccccce,5
"Practice to earn hearts Grey out , which I use a lot for random lessons. So, 3 stars now. This is also the reason I canceled my subscription. Or just give me an option to do a random lesson. Over 1300 days streak and now looking for alternatives",3
filled with AI garbage,1
I really enjoy this challenge ☺️,5
"Where are the grammar tips? Now there are only some ""key sentences"" - they do not explain anything!!!",2

"i learning chinese, and i am very surprised that it teach you also the symbols!!!",5
The hearts take too long to be replenished. I could wait an entire day after losing all my hearts in the morning and return to just a heart extra. It's inconvenient. Lessons take too long to load too. Please do something. Thanks.,2

I think after completing all the lakes I will get some surprise but I get nothing from it it's total time waste after completing 10 leauge and wastage of all data please don't download Duolingo 🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭🤬🤬🤬,1
First with the hearts that wont the app let you to exercise to reach complete 5 hearts..now the app show you you get 30xp but it actually add you 20xp and thats why i couldnt make through the diamond league..and spent a lot of gems..and of course time..thats completely fraud..do you force us to spend money on free app..shame on you duolingo institution 👎👎,1
perfect!,5
great :),5
i like to learn languages in Duolingo it is so much fun and teaches better than our teachers 😃,4
good,5
best app to learn English and speaking,5
"Since the hearts system came in, it seems ridiculous to cut someone's learning so short over a single letter mistake. Usually a great app, completely ruined by not allowing someone to progress. Almost seems like they should remove the 'free' version and just force the paid one now.",2
great,5
this is so helpful and fun. it gives us a lot of options. it starts with small words and as we move forward it becomes hard. I love this app. I would recommend this app to the people which want to learn new languages.,5

Not getting double xp after completing a lesson and it's hard to stay in diamond league when others gets the double xp and moving forward.,1
I have been using this app for several years and have enjoyed it... however... recently the ads have been getting way more frequent and the ads are mostly scams that are hard to close and rely on you accidentally clicking on the wrong spot. Shame on you duo. You used to be cool but greed has gotten the best of you.,2
it is really good app it helps me in my french,5

this is the best app this app helped me to learn music there are more language the best part is it give you reminder to complete your streak and you can even learn maths!,5
really good,5
I absolutely love this app!!,5
There are many times when the English sentence does not match the Indonesian or Italian sentence. I keep having to hit the flag button and submitting the error. It would also help if the course would explain why sentences are the way they are. Right now I am having to figure out everything on my own. If Duolingo is not going to explain why then I might as well just use Google Translate.,3
"Hello everyone this app is best for learning English and I have this AP from 8 days. It has not been much day since I started learning English but I have learned a lot of English, that is why I have completed it in just 1 day. I have given my best performance. Let's see further whether my English improves or not. I am confident that it will improve. I know English 40%.",2

nice!!! 😎😎,5
"I like that whatever language you're learning the app teaches it to in different ways , e.g. , the way you're being taught Arabic would be alot different to the way you're taught Italian. I do have just one complaint, why has earning free lives been taken away, don't you want people to spend more time learning , they can't do that if you're limiting the amount of lives they get and on top of that you're not even refilling them fast enough . This ruins the app experience.",3
bagus sekali,5

This is very nice and important app,5
best platform good👍,5
"This app is amazing, I learned how to speak English.",4
it is the best application to learn a new language I learned norwegian on Duolingo and I am now a little more fluent at norwegian than before . Thank you Duolingo!! But the heart feature in the app isn't that great.,4

"I have been using Duolingo for a while, and while the app is great for language learning, it has some serious technical issues that disrupt the experience. 1. Offline Mode Bug – Every time I open the app, it incorrectly shows ""You are offline,"" even when my internet connection is stable. This makes it frustrating to start lessons. 2. Streak Tracking Issue – Even after completing lessons or tasks, my streak doesn’t update. This is extremely discourag",2

Please add Tamil and Sinhala languages,4
"The structure of the lessons is helpful and fun, and the interface is easy to use. They lose two stars for aggressive money grubbing; I remember a time before they interrupted every lesson with ads, and it was a better product. Presumably they were still making money back then, so I can only assume someone wanted more short-term gains at the cost of product quality. This issue is fixable and will earn my 5 star rating.",3

👍,5
ok,4
Useful,5
"Good app, but the streak system very tedious. It puts you in a mindset that makes you have a new fear and chore to do your duolingo lesson or lose your steak. Maybe they could make it progress based and not doing a lesson EVERY day which like I stated it's very tedious.And the avcivites you do are kinda boring after a will. I wish it was more interactive or more fun. They should do more than translating. This app is good if you are taking lesson from a native speaker and duolingo is extra help.",3
Best of learning English Apps,5
I love it very much! it helps me learn any language I want! 😊👍,5
I really love it,5
A great app and productivity tool for practicing a second language everyday. I took one star because even when you have one paid tier there are a lot of ads for upgrading which gets kind of annoying.,4
lern da language make!!!,5
good,5
Can No Longer Practice for Hearts. Instead they want you to pay for them. What a pathetic money grab.....,1
"Easy to learn. Love that you hear, read and speak !!! Unfortunately the customer service is bad. There are problems with getting the promised points when doing exercises. Contacted customer service many times, informing them about a problem but the only confirm getting the report but not doing anything about ir. Problem is now for over 2 month and nothing happens. Not an individuell answer to the problem, not fixing it at all. This shows how much they care about there customers. Bad attitude!!!",2
we can learn other languages,5
it is very good to learn other languages from Duolingo😁,5

fun and essential,5
it's the best learning language app,5
Bro never ever buy subscription on this app they even not rfund it 🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡,1
"I LOVE the lessons, but HATE the guilt trips! I work a lot and can only use the app when I have extra time. It's constantly acting like a neglected love interest! Makes me less motivated to open it or learn. It's annoying.",2
great app,5
"UPDATE - 2/8/2025 - Now it's not awarding double points when it's supposed to be. This has happened twice today, so annoying! ******************** Not happy that you can no longer replenish back up to 5 hearts-that really SUCKS! I like the app mostly, but it does count a lot of correct answers as incorrect frequently. It really pisses me off when it exhausts all of my hearts for correct answers, and I have to start a lesson over. Also, the hints are almost always wrong! Do better, Duolingo!",1
It's very amazing.,5
thank you Duolingo.,5
"A really clean interface, funny engagement tactics, feels more like a game than a learning tool. very pricey 🫰😔",4
I feel pissed off when I report the same mistake over and over again boy nobody cares.,1
need more levels in Finnish,3
But this take too much time for downloading,4
awesome!,5
u get yo learn alot,5
"Used to be the best app, simple and efficient. Now it is too complicated with NO OPTIONS for us to adjust the course (e.g I don't want to practice writing. Why forcing me to so that??). Also how on earth you teach beginners names of food before you teach them basic words like Hello, How Are You, Bye etc..",1
very good app I use Duolingo daily.,4
good app,5
"SOO GOOD! all the languages you can learn, and if you wanna be like your family, this will help! Love it!",5
"An exceptional app to learn Mandarin, because it is more effective if we learn to write the characters. I learned faster by writing the characters onto a notebook or pieces of paper. I want to learn Hindi but have no intention to learn & write Hindi characters. Is there any option in Duolingo to allow this?",5
best app is for learning. its best feature is it nudge we for learning.,4
super best app in yt kailash gameing guru rating,5
Duo is very useful to me for learning Spanish language. Gracias Duo,5

I've been learning Japanese with my friends and Duolingo has made it fun for me and interesting.It is an awesome app that makes me laugh and learn with my own effort.,4
This app is great and helps a lot in learning new languages,5
I LOVE THIS APP I HAVE 2 STREAKKKKK,5
it's fun and very functional!!! love it!!!,5
Just the best learning app for beginners looking to learn a new language from scratch. I'd highly recommend it. It's like your own pocket teacher!,5
great free learning platform that motivates you to stay on track with daily practice.,5
It's great at helping at learning a language but sometimes I get a question that is at a way higher level than what I'm currently learning.,4
the app is good,5
Great so far after 30 straight days! Feel like I'm well on my way to being able to speak German confidently for my trip in five months.,5
"fun, easy, pleasant and efficient since it makes us realize our mistakes,and tests us,again on them, so it is personalized",5
"2 years I'm using the app and it's worst every year. I would suggest to try other app before subscribe to this one. I reported also several times to customer support about bugs in the way the scores are calculated but no one came back to me and also it's a pity to have french and dutch in the app but to don't let french speaker learns dutch, especially for Belgian people.",2
"I had originally given Duolingo a high review, but it has degraded so much from the point it was at a few years ago. The app is an endless ad circuit now and has no real functionality for free users. It is too heavily reliant on AI and pushes their premium products endlessly. You used to be able to practice to earn more hearts, now you must pay money. The language learning element is gone, this app is dying. Stay away.",1
It is fanTASTIC💜,5
so much love this app,5
"Fantastic learning tool, loving it so far.",5
a great way to learn and connect with distant family members,5
it made me feel bad and scared,2
"good service!, matututo ka talaga!",5
i give 5 Star this because I learned many languages,5
It's a slay app!!!😀🙂🫠😉😊😚,5
I love this app but why are all the end of lesson graphics suddenly ugly or unpleasant? Please bring back the older ones,5
"Awesome 🤗 tengo 840 días con dúo, español, deutsch, italiano",5
It Is actually a good platform for learning new language,4
Amazing lessons.,5
its a really good app :3,5
The study reminders are awful. You're shamed for not opening the app when they think you should be. I struggle to build new habits as a lot of people do so I don't need to feel worse about it than I already do.,1
I wish they would teach you the words before making completely sentences lol I feel like they just throw you into sentences.,1
I really love this app it saved me to practice my English as well,5
I'm only doing to get my child back,5
"Good program but the Timed lessons do Not provide a way to listen well, repeat well, reply well nor learn well. I understand that speed of what you've learned is good but Correctness is Better. Will not buy but will continue with Duo for now...",3
"Duolingo, famous for its quirky reminders, is as much a memorization game as a language education tool, and that's OK. Play is fun, and comes in bite-sized chunks, perfect for short breaks on the phone when one wants to both have a break, and be virtuous at the same time.",5
it is perfect,5
he sees you when you miss a lesson. :),5
"Ya se me quito la queja, compre el super duolingo.",5
Entertaining. lots of fun. I'd like to build a dictionary of words I've learned.,5
Very good. I'm enjoying a lot.,5
Duolingo wrecked it when they removed teams!,2
Duolingo well I've got to say I absolutely love this app it is super awesome I think out of all the other Spanish learning apps whatever you want to call it you have to pay for a free trial and things like that I don't even have to pay anything not unless I want to get Duolingo super and I really appreciate how this app was made I listen to your podcasts on Spotify although there's something I do not like about this app I think we should get a few more hearts overall it's a good app 💚💚💚💚💚,5
جميل,5
"It's AMAZING! I'm learning Japanese, Japanese is on of the top 5 hardest languages to learn and I didn't even know it!",5
"Was a one time devotee of this app learning Italian, but now I find I cannot get into the app it freezes and says it's Loading but nothing happens after that.",2
This app is so helpful,4
"It's good, but also a nightmare when your dyslexic, ended up paying subscription because I'd always run out of hearts because of spelling (why I knocked a star off). It is addictive.",4
I love it. I'm learning Arabic.❤❤❤❤😝,5
Duo and his friends really help me with my Japanese,5
"Like the app, but it doesn't help me in conversation with ppl imagine me saying hello In japanese and don't know what to say next. How to get a friendly conversation with a person is what I aim for but I'm not really getting it.....Also the issues of heart and having to pay is not really making me want to invite others to use this app. And also paying to recheck on your mistake. Arigatou.",1
Duolingo is really good and interesting to learning English and others idioms...,5
Bien,3
I am really enjoying learning french.,4
Easy to navigate. Make learning a new language easy.,5
i'm sorry Duolingo AAAAAAAA,5
Brilliant... if you pay. There are way too many advertisements for anything remotely productive on the free version.,4
amazing try now has duolingo max with free adds you can complete 4.6%,5
"Love this. I'm studying the languages of the country I was born 🇫🇷 and lived 🇩🇪, As well as 🇪🇸 which is used a lot where I currently reside. Definitely don't like the commercials so I will most likely get the paid app as I continue to progress along",5
"Duolingo app is the best , as a student duolingo has made me to be perfect in french. I also recommend that some student should use duolingo",5
I love it,5
is good,5
perfect language school,5
Good but Boost the heart rates,4
Just try it thank me later,5
its amazing and free DOWNLOADD NOWW,5
"The paid version changes the experience completely. If you want to actually learn, it's a game changer. so easy to get pulled in and it actually feels like I'm learning.",5
nice,5
Proper learning,5
love uuuu,5
I love this app. It's the best!!!!!!,5
"This used to be the best language learning app but not anymore... now its very bad. From forcing you to mindlessly keep going in expense of actual learning, to having removed valuable community discussions to be replaced by ai for a price, to spikes in difficulity usually after your second lesson in a row and half way into third designed to spend your hearts to force payment... Oh and its not a ""mission"" anymore its a business, fix your ad justification",1
I've only been using this app for 10 days and I'm only committed to 3 min per day (some days I keep playing because it's so fun) and already I can speak some sentences. My 10 year old daughter got excited about it too so she downloaded the app and now we can talk to each other in Spanish (a few simple sentences). She has so much fun on the app that I've made it a time that she can't play until her homework is done. I wish we could gamify her homework too!,5
Is fun and you can lean different stuff,5
nice ❤,5
Good for learning,5
just wonderful! I'm enjoying every lesson,5
It was fun but also not that helpful,3
duolingo scares me,5
I love this menace 💕,5
very good 💯,5
addictive in a good way,5
"Duolingo çok güzel bir uygulama, hedeflerini kısa sürede tamamlayabiliyorsun. Herkese tavsiye ediyorum.",5
"Duolingo is not free. Its a scam. You pay them to (forced) warch advertisments every day, so many times when you use it. Also you need to PAY MORE, if you dont want to watch ads. Liars. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED to use it at all.",1
excellent method,5
Membership features are super glitchy,4
Nice,5
So many ads is literally impossible to focus. You can't learn anything of substance without paying their insane subscription prices anymore. And the AI voices they use now are utter garbage. This app is so much worse these days.,1
Easy and self-paced,5
Excelent,5
very nice app helps me learn more languages,5
"it is the best application for learning a language.. good structure , interactive, approachable interface, captivating stories, and it keeps you entertained, while culturally adapted",5
I am having a good time with Duolingo ٩😀۶ 〈😀ノ,5
Needs all languages menu and a surprise when finish lesson,3
"Very great app, I wish some of the premium features were free tho like explaining my mistake",4
It's Good For Language Learning But BRING BACK PROFILE PICTURES!!! 😭😭😭,3
"Duolingo uses many methods to ensure that you are able to read, speak, and understand another language. My kids love it! It is like a game to them that happens to be educational.",5
love owl ❤,4
it is gooooooooooooooood,5
video calls don't respond this is something vital to learning and it's not just my phone I've asked others,3
I love this app because its helps you learn any language and it like a game😁,5
I LOVE DOULINGO!!!!,5
The application is simple and educatives,3

"this, help me learn to speak Italian so I can speak to people when I go to Italy",5
"We also want ( indian [SANSKRIT] language), There are many learners waiting for this language, hope you understand, by need also by business point of view,😇 thank you 🙏",4
it's cool,5
I'm learning Japanese it's so good try it,5
It is kinda horrible to lose the streak entirely over a mistake with no way to recover it. Kinda makes me want to quit,1
great product overall but I paid for the deluxe version and it stopped the ads but no features worked,3
Awesome!,5

Kinda fun.,4

Ridiculously Brilliant Majestically Awesome What a Fantastic App. Gracias,5
"I would like to report a bug, but i dont know where. For some reason in German course section 2 unit 10 last one before completing the unit I'm only getting half the exp (might be due to the app thinking that it has been completed), also for some reason every time i check competition before doing a lesson my lesson gets reset even if i have completed it, i have done it multiple times (~8 by now, but to complete it you only need 3, its been reset 5 times by now). The reseting started 5 days ago.",4
"It's pretty good, but would be better if there was Lithuanian for those who want to learn.",4
Love it. surprisingly effective,5

Duolingo is a spectacular app.,5
it's fun to use,5
Amazing,5
It is really annoying when you lose your streak and if you take a break for like 1 week or so you forget things and then you don't know what to do and it's really annoying and when you run out of hearts it's hard to get them back,3
I love this app way more than I thought I would. it's great fun,5
Las lecciones se vuelven repetitivas con el tiempo,3
"It's an amazing app,",5

I LOVE IT I LEARNED SO MUCH KOREAN THANK U DUO😆,5
"The app is awesome, but I hate paying for learning more.",3
easy to make time for every day although it is a slow start with words it's just what a beginner needs,5
perfect,5
❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
great,5
quick like it. my Spanish teacher likes that I use it. it's LIT,4
"this is really nice,like I am really interested in this app , because I can't believe that i am the one learning Chinese and I don't know it is so easy to learn it",5
excellent app best for beginner's and for student's to,5
I really love this app😻😻,5
U know what I don't like this app I love it,5
👍,5
good 👍,2
"great pictures, examples, and feedback.",5
is very good,5
This app reminds me daily of what I have to do and what my goals are,5
yeah it's a very useful app I like it very much,5
can't practice if hearts are full and can't earn hearts until have 0 of them. Duolingo eagerness to make money,1
Good experience indeed,4
Duolingo really helps me learn proper grammar and pronunciation. Working on it every day helps my retention.,5
it have many language to learn the character exercise they have to do more app like this we can learn more thing from their,2
very useful app 💯😸,5
👍,5
"It's a good app, but why is it that if I mess up 4 times, I can't do anything unless I pay experience. And if I don't understand what I did wrong and get help, I have to pay a subscription, I think the high-school classes are would be a better idea because they want you to learn and they help and not say, no, if you want to do this more you have to pay 1000 experience, they HELP you",2
😁,5
Nice app,5
Good. Kinda creepy But other than that Yeah it's not bad,4
Great for learning a new language!,4
makes it fun and emersive.,5
This app stalks me and knows when to tell me it's study time. lol,5
"Wow. Yah just wow. This is amazing, I have been learning italiana for only 30 days and already know over 150 words. this may be the best app I have ever invested in. Although, without paying, you have to watch very short ads, and only have limited lives. This app is truly amazing, thanks duo!",5
This is the best language learning app,5
"Was really good, but for some reason after the last update you can no longer do unlimited practice to fill up your hearts. Not sure if this is an accident or if y'all have gotten cheap and want us to pay for hearts. Please fix this. I use the practice to keep up with what I've already learned. Not being able to practice is holding us back!",1
love love love make it fun and challenging to learn something new.,5
I LOVE DUO HES ON MY WALLPAPER! PLS DON'T KIDNAP ME LOL LOVE YA BYEE,5
amazing app I like it,5
it's a good app to learn a Launuage and incorage a friend :),5
"There's a great app in here. Unfortunately it's buried under some of the most predatory ""free to play"" monetization I've ever seen. Pay to be able to access content. Pay to be able to use the app more if you make a mistake while learning. Pay to actually have lessons that explain core concepts like conjugating verbs. It is so deeply user hostile that I would not recommend to anyone except as a way to get suplimentary experience while taking real lessons elsewhere.",2
bestt,5
لكن تنفع الصحة في دقيقة للاسف,5
I can't learn because I don't have hearts it's unfair and I can't learn my lessons because of it,2
Good app thank you Duolingo😍🥰😄,5
Duolingo didn't have first line by line alphabet I think alphabet is more important 🙂‍↕️and everything is good 😇I'm suggest please line by line alphabet is also important 🫠,5
great way to learn Spanish,5
"one thing that i cannot get over is the fact that they made this app suited for procrastinators like me, i mean, you can't just ignore duolingo's notifications that easily😂.",5
excellent,5
"o Duolingo é bom e continuando eles poderiam nos ensinar algo mais avançado, para quem claro tem um inglês mais avançado.",4
ausome,5
please attach commonly used vocabulary,5
It is the best app for learning languages💯💯,5
"I love this app it helps me alot and it makes me ahead in languages like in my class,but I also wish the app can add thai because I also want to learn Thai.",5
it is so wonderful . it teaches u any language u like for example I am interested in French evn now I know how to introduce myself in French,5
Duolingo is wonderful app please download and improve your spoken English... A to Z,5
This app is amazing! it can help you learn so many languages and if you are struggling with something. It knows. It takes time with the harder things. I also love that you can learn almost every language and it even includes MUSIC AS ONE! Thanks duo!,5
helpful and easy but i hate the game ads.,3
this app boosted my corear,5
I love arabic language so I can learn it in this app,5
"Getting 20+ Super Duolingo ads during Happy Hour that are longer than the lessons, the app crashing after certain ads, and users using XP hacks in league without any repercussions are all issues that are frustrating beyond belief.",1

"Although it is a very good app for learning.anyone can learn any language.i love this app but,I am having a small glitch that my league is not showing and my profile is showing private.i even emailed it but no reply.so,I request duilingo operators to look after it.please it is a request.",4
"Practical, useful and attractive",5
I'm a complete beginner. Having some issues navigating it at the moment but I'm enjoying it. I'm sure it will improve.,3
really good app,5
Great 👌,5
"I really like this app but I have noticed that it doesn't explain some things. For example: it has started putting an ""A"" in front of a sentence and it has shortened some words. This is all done without an explanation as to why the changes. It's quite confusing so it makes it more difficult to move forward with my lessons.",4
it's the best 🤩,5
Good app,5
great app,5

very good app,5
"The app has completely gone down the drain. The tree, the hearts, the story removal and all has just been pain. But the worst part is the translations being worse and sometimes completey wrong. The 2 stars are just for me using it for so long .",2
Nice app helps a lot for language lover and from my opinion Plz add the languages particular alphabet. Thank you!,4
it's a great learning app but so many notifications some are helpful some aren't,4
very good app,5
very nice,5
"There's been a drop in quality recently. They're locking new features behind a second subscription, teasing you with them during the free course and they're adding new listening tasks where the conversation is between text to speech bots, not actual humans. The stressing of words is all wrong and makes learning more difficult.",1
"adds everywhere, some of the lessons dont makr sense. useful for very basic learning",2
best app,5
App is so cool,5
The ads are so annoying There is an ads after every lesson that really annoys me and make me mad I'm thinking of deleting the app I don't have money Duolingo I can't buy anything 💔,2
The best😊❤️.,5
"I tell you what, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer or the brightest crayon in the box; but I sure am enjoying learning Chinese and refreshing myself with math. It keeps the mind sharp to continue learning.",5
"If you disable animations, the leaderboard does not refresh. Fix that and I'll give you five stars.",3
Will rate 5 when Mandarin Chinese becomes available to learn!,5
I wish this app scaled horizontally and not just vertically on my Samsung tablet or iPad.,3
"I love y'all, the bird is so cute",5
Iam traped in his basement forced to give 5 stars (joke the app is really goood for learning),5
I know Chinese now but it's kinda annoying that you gotta play real money for hearts😵‍💫,4

excellent app ♥️♥️♥️,5
is very nice app and it help us to learn English will,5
this is so good,5
"8th time scraping by to finish a lesson without hearts. Browbeating isn't teaching, repetition of being shown your broke is demoralizing. Apparently I rub my face in mud to keep a streak. Thank you for the indignanty of continual parroting something I don't comprehend, rather than help me conceptualize. Not an app for people with dyslexia, spelling counts, they don't always correct spelling if you're a letter off, which allows you to more easily misspell. 40 min effort somedays, to keep streak.",1
It's very funny and easy to learn.,5
the very best,5
interesting,5
Very interesting and easy to understand I love it,5
Best app,5
nice app,5
good 👍🏻,5
"Is great and all, however a technical between Duolingo and Google. I tried to cancel my premium version but refused, and contacted the helpline but was not helpful.",1
I did not get the rewars even after i complete them leading to my demotion.I am telling to improve it because it hurts.This is my honest review.,3
Great app to learn and practice easily.,5
Fantastic app for learning a language,5

love this app but I hate the fact you can't make mistakes :(,4
It is very good,5
"It is game like, so it is not too intimidating. It allows you to listen sometimes and even say some of the material back to see if you can speak it as well. It is not hard at all if you start on beginner, and it is teaching more in depth than I have experienced before",5
it's super helpful,5

"Doulingo is actually an amazing language learning app. I'm currently learning Russian (I also know how to speak polish fluently,) and it is very fun to learn, plus it is very similar to polish, so it is easier for me. The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ads that you occasionally get while finishing a lesson. The ads aren't honestly that annoying it's just I didn't really think doulingo would ever put ads into their app. Otherwise, amazing app to learn a new language.",4

Bro . just unbelievable animations . bro 😎😎😎😎🧉🧉🧉🧉🧉🧉 you are best,5
"fun, but.... I wish it was geared earlier to everyday interactions you would encounter while traveling. ex. restaurants, ordering and asking for the check, finding things in stores , navigating airports where people don't speak English, asking directions, etc. it really misses the mark in being everyday useful to a traveler. also, there are grammar rules that should be explained better for those that want to know the rules. it could be an optional ""tip"" that people could click on.",3
superb,5
so much fun with Duolingo plus his so cute and adorable and a great weekend 😊 😍 😊 😍 😊 😍 😍 😊 😊 😍 😍 😍 😊 😍 😊 😍 😍,5

superb app for learning every language even with adds it is interesting and keeps you going with rewards no matter what thank u duolingo lot of math problems ans are wrong with slider plz fix,5
"For people who are struggling with learning languages, this is the PERFECT app for you! Duolingo makes it easier by making step by step progresses, and plus it motivates you by giving you challenges and trying to do at least a lesson a day. There are ads but ads that are for Duolingo's subscription plans like family plans or Max. I would say this is a really good app for learning languages but also maths and music!",5
exceptional,5
nice app,5
this s app make me a good language speaking person so you can try,5
nice,5
well,5
It is useful for learning different languages ​​but the same sentences appear over and over again and in some lessons it shows a mistake even if the answer is correct,4
"It makes it easy to learn with repetition, sounds, and written words.",5
Thank you,5
it's good but you have to pay to mKe your learning better so I don't really like that but over all good becuse some people have other bills to pay an paying for super dualingo then duolingo MAZ came out now I can't get either becuse I have to do other things and no I'm not paying for one free trial for one week over all the learning systems 👍 good,4
I like it,5
Good,4
Some sentences are incorrect but overall it's okay. Also if you're gonna put ads after most free lessons at least make the wait time for hearts shorter so we free folk can get more use out of the app considering it's way too expensive for some people.,4

An awesome app that helps boost your competence,5

New Duolingo SUCKS!!!!! Doing everything they can to force users to spend money and upgrade. I'm so mad I would give just about any other language app developer my money other than Duo.,1
this app really motivates you to try and learn new languages! really helpful if you plan on taking a language in school or you go on a trip.,5
very good game 👍,5
nice apps,5
I love,5
"This app is literally good. It helped me so much with my language subjects at school. I usually learn Chinese. This app is simple, fun to engage in and good cayse it contains achievements and everything. But it really needs to add SINHALA LANGUAGE. I would love to see my mother language here, cause all I know is that the sinhala language is fun to learn and not that hard......it's a suggestion though......😇🥰 Thanks duo!",5
quick and easy!! it's the best 👍😁,5
super Duolingo,5
"it's the best so far,I will recommend it to anyone that wants to learn any language.",5
so good 💯,5
"Seems to be a nice app for learning a language with some small bugs: When translating to English or German, there are often multiple correct word orders, but the app expects a specific word order. The app does allow to right away feedback on this, so I hope that will be fixed soon, then I will update to 5 stars.",4
Good app,4

"Buggy app , Premium and ""max"" still show adds . CEO refuses to add any customer support relying only in really bad ai for support .

There is a bug where you can't progress any further(known for at least couple of years and many complaints you can find online and nothing has been done about it) no response from support team(shocking!!!)it's a random thing so for some people it happens after couple of months or 2 years!!!,1

outstanding language learning application,5
Fun to use,5
"very good,detailed,and easy learning higly recommended",5
impressive,2
I enjoy learning with duolingo,5
Changed the format to be about AD watch and not learning. They removed the ability for practice to ensure failure leads to watching more ads. They have made learning hard by punishing the learner which makes the process harsh and makes me want to drop this app for another. Whoever thought this should be fired,1
this app makes learning fun and is easy to follow,5
"Its really to bad that greed has takin over this country. Duolingo used to have an awesome free play mode. But then they got a taste of that money, that was all it took them came the ads, now you can't even practiced stuff you've already learned. Basically, if you can't afford to pay a subscription, you're not gonna learn anything. There's no explanation of anything. It feels very unwelcoming playing on Free mode. These app owners just think everyone in America is super rich and stupid.",2
such nice application for spoken English learns,5
nice app,5
Nice,4
that's the best learning app!🤩🤩🤩,5
Cool app,5
very good and bussin :D nice. 5 star ¿ tú hables español?,5
sehr gut,5
"This app is so helpful to learn korean. It's true that you have it learn about korean alphabet, words etc. by yourself for learning this language well but duolingo helps a lot to practice and memorize the words. No app or academy can teach you well unless you try hard so you have to keep patience and study well. Overall it's a good app.",5
increasing my skill,5
I really like how this app helps a user to understand a language in no time. Thanks to Duolingo I'm now into Spanish,5
This is the best opportunity to improve or learn a language I loveee duo and Duolingo. I have a suggestion: it will be so good if we can talk with someone in the game I mean a robot or something we can improve our speaking and the robot make our mistake. My English is not so good I'm learning now I hope you can understand ❤️.,5
Am doing french lessons at school and I was really confused but after installing Duolingo I started understand french .Now I a' s all my french tests,5
lovely app,5
Ads are over the top,3
it is really a very good teaching,5
I have learned Italian and it was very easy with duolingo😊,5

Good,5
It's very good and I learned Chinese so quick it helped me so much and now I'm keep learning new words I definitely recommend it 👍,5
Great.,1
good 😊,4
there's no option for Urdu speakers very dissipated,1
"Love Duolingo but I'm very upset they have removed the option to ""earn hearts by practising"" This was a great part of the app because then if I run out of hearts, I would do 5 practise sessions (further helping me learn the words and phrases from previous lessons through repetition) and then carry on with my lessons. It was a big part of the app for me as I would spend a long session learning. Now if I make mistakes thats the end of my lessons for a few hours. Please put this back!",3
it helps improve your knowledge of other languages,4

too much advertisement,3
I am learn Korean and English,5
"Would love to give this 5 stars as is a brilliant app that changes how language learning is viewed. However too much of the vocabulary is kind of silly and irrelevant. I think this is done to be funny, but I would really appreciate learning the most useful and most used words. Like less snakes and hares in russian!",3

Great but pls add afrikaans I have a big exame on that,4
good 👍,3
"After doing a lesson you have to first wait for the stupid animation and what not, then wait for an ad to show up, and play for 5s or more. Then you have to wait for the super or max ad which runs for 30 seconds. So after every lesson it's almost a minute gone before you can start the next. It's just plain annoying and I believe it's only going to get worse.",2
"great app, but pro is too expensive for many people",4
very good app bahut achcha hai 10 out of 10 🫰🫰🫰🫰👌👌,5
"I love it, it helps me learn, it's so much fun, and duo is so cute, I love birds ❤🐦🐦, I love this app so much, download it if you want to learn, but you don't have to if you don't want to",5
Mind-blowing application. I highly recommend this application .,5

I'm writing a new review and reducing the star. Right now the App is getting frustrating if you are not a Super user. Even when you get double XPs mosttimes it doesn't show on the leaders board.(Edit) It keeps getting worse I can't access the leaderboard recently and the XPs don't add up when it opens.,2

"This app is really helpful. I just hope that they fix some minor punctuations in the translations.

"""I'm absolutely obsessed with Duolingo! The app is incredibly well-designed, making it easy to learn a new language at my own pace. The bite-sized lessons and interactive exercises are perfect for busy days, and the gamification elements keep me motivated to reach my goals. Plus, the community is super supportive and encouraging. I've already recommended Duolingo to all my friends and family - it's a game-changer for language learners!"" 5/5 stars ""Love how Duolingo is""🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🍝🍝🍝🍝",5

it's a really good learning app and I learned German super fast! Totally recommend 👌,5
"Duolingo is not the app to use if you want to learn a language quickly. Super slow, I learnt more words in a day than the time I spent on Duolingo which was like 200 days.",2
"This app is great for basic, but random, vocabulary but nothing else. It used to be focussed on making learning free and explaining grammatical things to be aware of. However, it is now far more focussed on making money and gate-keeping explanations. I used to recommend this app often, I wouldn't recommend it any more.",2
best features,5

every time ad pops up. but this app teaches me the slowest.,3
"I have been using Duolingo since it launched. It seems a very good app to learn new languages through its various ways by listening,speaking,reading fun lessons etc . I have learnt 3 languages so far from Duolingo. Although for some reasons I don't know i'm having issues with the speaking lessons nowadays and I am unable to do so as it's stating an 'error occurred try again later' . I hope they fix this sooner.👍",4
Duolingo is very nice. I love it...,5
very good especially those students who want to learn other languages,5
Great 👍👍👍👍👍,5
the problem is the premium 😔😔,4

"It is so good to use. It is fun, and I can remember the phrase. When I run out of life and I go to practice to gain lives, I can only get three of 4 lives. It makes doing the lessons harder. Does this happen to anyone else. Is there a way to fix this?",3
очень хорошо я уже смогу полностью говорить английском,5
"this app is very nice if you did not talk , write or understand English or other language so this app can improve your talking skill , writing skill and understanding so Download the Doulingo app😊😊",5
"I like how easy it makes it to learn a language. The app also makes it a lot of fun. Easy to use app, no issues with crashing, and the fact that it's free makes it worth the few ads you have to watch.",5

W app it helps a lot,5
excellent ✌🏼,5
This app made me great student and commitment person. Thanks,4
it easy until you get even further in.,4
"It's just okay. I've had several years of language lessons so I understand the grammar and a lot of vocabulary, but the app itself does a poor job of teaching you. Learning verb conjugations is impossible. Also the ads are annoying, and I considered subscribing, but I cannot find pricing info anywhere (maybe it's when you click the ""start free trial"" button? But I don't want to accidentally start the trial...). From other reviews it seems like Super only removes half the ads.",3
beautiful,5
"paid or free, just dedicate yourself to learning and you can succeed",5
this is aap very nice and funny😝,5
good,5
good,5
Duolingo is my current best friend. Thanks for this user friendly application.,5
it's fantastic 😊,4
"it,s better",5
nice 👍 I am happy,5
"App is good, used to be better. It is plagued by ads now. I am doing the trial of the single super subscription and now, instead of getting ads for super (which is supposed to be ad free) I get ads for ""max"" and family plans. Why lie and say super is ad free? Edit: I decided to cancel the trial and uninstall.",3
pretty good but I wish we all had no lives so we can try to get it right but that's the only thing I don't like about doulingo and I also hate the fact of the ads I know they are in all games I just don't like the ads to but over all they are pretty good. good job doulingo and make sure to see their youtube channel to they name is doulingo yeah but they are the only thing I hate about doulingo I aso like the maths and the music dou wont get me bc I have a 3 day streak lol,4
learning is fun,5
really good ✨😉,5
good,5

"I've been using this app since early last year and it's been really helpful in learning Spanish, practicing every day has really helped me learn. when i see people speaking it on TV or out in public, i understand some things they're saying which is a lot different than how it was before. i enjoy the new mini game feature they have in the store and such :)",5
good this apps.,5
Excellent app and last update is awesome 👍,5
it helped me with Spanish so much no ads even I think this is the best learning app I've ever used,5
it's a very good E-Learning app but everytime you complete a stage it shows super duolingo adds . I suggest the staff to make the add appear less,5
"Have checked Duolingo with Viet friends for accuracy with ""street Vietnamese"". Friends have said most phrases are accurate with only very subtle differences. eg street Viet likely wouldn't ask for a ""cup of coffee"" since the cup is implied. Street Viet would just ask for coffee with the ""cup"" inferred (after all, how else does one drink coffee). Otherwise very happy with Duolingo's approach to teaching the language!! Thank you Duolingo!!!",5
great tool to learn languages,5
nice app and help my learning english.everyone try It's app,5
i love doulingo so much,5
it's not bad,4
"it's a great app to be able to learn a lot of different languages. The only type of criticism in my house that doesn't really affect it is that it should have more options for more languages( I gave you a good review, now please let my family go)",5
Good app ! but that super douling are in paid !,4
"I heard about this app from a Twitch streamer that was playing it on stream. I tried it for myself to learn a bit Chinese just for fun. And it surely was a lot of fun. It even includes practice for the characters. I like it. I really wish it could actually show me how expensive the ad free version is. If I can keep up with learning, it is probably worth the money.",5
Because it's good langueage,5
good app,5
👀❤️👀,4
really nice and very helpful for those who are broken ( don't have money to study languages),5

Best if you want to get the basics down.❤️❤️❤️,5

this is very very nice 👍 I like most of english language keep it up thank you Duolingo I am very happy ❤️ it was very interesting again thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️,5
It's pretty easy if you wanna learn an easy language but lessons do progress and get very harder only for you to learn some sentences but you will be able to know what people are talking about in that language,5
this app is a very good,5
its a very good app im learning german successfully at my own pace and in addition the app makes it fun to learn i would reccommend this app if your aiming to learn a new language,5
good app in all subject,5
Duolingo helps so much with learning a language but mainly just for fun. If you're learning because you wanna go somewhere then try one of the apps you gotta pay for but if it's just for fun then this is amazing. I'm Greek and trying to reconnect with my roots and are now doing this to learn (Im not even a teenager yet and I'm learning a. new language). Trust me it's not that deep just learn the new language.,5
good app 👍,5
nice,5
I enjoyed,4
so fun even wen I get a question wrong it is so cute with the little owl,5
very useful thankyou,5
Great learning pace. Simple learning.,5
"Using duolingo on Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra. I'm trying to race to the top, trying to use the extra XP tokens you get from completing daily challenges. I complete them, but they're not applying. This is forcing me to do extra lessons to get more XP than it should. Fix this",1
great awesome thanks for letting me learn...,5
"I like the app. I have a suggestion though, can I get the ads in the language I'm learning? You get the ad revenue and I'm exposed to the language I'm learning more.",4
Excellent 💯.,5
GOOD,5
🙏,5
"I like this, but it moves slowly if you make fat-finger errors. Also, I can't ever speak while using the app, and there is no way to configure it for that.",5
比你妈妈还努力催你学习的小猫头鹰,5
it's the best app,5
master teacher,5
good,5
good very good thanks you so much deuligo,5
perfect,5
"Addictive and getting points feels productive, but... Not sure how much good a lot of good it does. I'm at 1/4 million points after 200ish days and certainly I'm not feeling fluent. Probably good as a booster if you move to a country and want to get up to speed fairly quickly. But it's kind of fun, I think.",2
nice apps,5
The best app for new language leaner.,5
it really teache how to speak Swedish!,4
Nice app,5

I am VERY irritated.. More with Google play than anything... I tried canceling subscription through duolingo app.. Thought I had still got charged.. Requested a refund from Google and got denied. I REFUSE to use the app if my money isn't refunded. VERY DISAPPOINTED DUOLINGO FOR SAYING ONLY GOOGLE PLAY CAN RESOLVE IT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH GOOGLE PLAY!!,1
"Excellent app, my only complaint is you get locked out after 5 errors, which are often due to tablet's spellcheck feature which changes your answer to a similar word in English or if you inadvertently hit the wrong key....so watch out for that, especially now that you can no longer do a review practice to earn hearts.",5
this app is very nice,5
great! now i can finish my deustch lessen,5
хороша,5

"Had you stopped shoving super duolingo down my throat every lesson, I wouldn't have abandoned my 1-year streak along with my motivation to use the app. Not only was it more prevalent than ads, it also played after the ads. The ads were acceptable, it's a free app and were still placed reasonably after some lessons. Meanwhile, superduo was not",3

great for learning a different language it is a great way to learn. but it is annoying when I make so many mistakes and u run out of hearts and you have to practice to refill them and it definitely can get very annoying especially when your Trying to learn a new language and u can't even finish the dahm lesson cuase u need gems to refill your hearts so you can continue. Would of been a 5 star app if there were no hearts but now it's a 3,3
The customer service is pretty darn slow but the app is engaging and fun,3
it's a lot of fun 😁,5
"I quite liked this app until it fed me an ad that tries to trick people into thinking their Google Docs app isn't up to date to get them to click a third party PDF viewer ad. That feels malicious for an app so widely used. Please review your advertisements, as I'd gladly pay to move elsewhere if this is how you treat your ad supported users.",2
bien,5
This app is really good I've been using it off and on for a few years but can you make it were when you lose all your hearts you have to wait a little less of that time because it's very down grading and when I want to do it and I mess up I cannot continue just reduce the waiting time please. And yes I know you can buy a membership but I'm a miner and I don't have a job so I cannot pay for it,5
average,3
Fun and motivating.,5
free languages,5
it's good,5
this is great learning for only 2 DAYS and i know basic sentences in spanish recommended just dont lose your streak....,5

It's actually like a game and you can also study I Love it,5
So far so good!!!,5

So much fun. You can learn different languages.,5
good,3
This app is very intelligence and very smart and i will rate on 5 stars,5
I wish it would let me practice to earn more hearts. Not beeing able to makes this app a LOT less worth using...,2

"I'm learning English and it's really good, but in speaking class I have to speak whale language for him to understand what I'm saying and he still doesn't understand. Note: I am Brazilian. And I urgently need to learn English as it will be good for me in the future at work. I demand that you fix this mistake so I can practice pronunciation without having to say it a million times for him to understand.",1
Very good! Duolingo really helped me to learn the kinds of languages! Thank you very much Duolingo!,5
"it is an amazing app and a fun way to learn language,it's like a game,I love it❤️❤️",5
Fast work,4
"This app needs a subscription tier that removes avatars (what's wrong with profile photos?) and removes the square, angry character. What are you so mad about, little guy? Turns my stomach every time! Woke nonsense. Hola Google, como se dice woke in Espanol?",1
learning experience is super,5
♥️♥️,5
best app ever,5
good,5
I like it.I'm learning a lot of words in Korean.It's also fun:),5
very nice for learning,5
Very good,3
Duolingo ist unglaublich,5
A fun way to learn,5
I love the review and repetition. I love how every modality is being taught. I really love Duolingo. ❤️,5
Easy-to-use.,4
nice,4
it helps me learn languages easy,5
you can learn in easy steps doing a bit each day,5
absolutely love duolingo. I love that I can still learn bit by bit daily without having to pay for the upgrades but the super does offer alot of benefits. I like how the app introduces new words and then refreshes you with older words learned. I've started to comprehend more and more as I go just from how it intrigrates everyday conversations. very good app!,5
HE ATE THIS UP,5
I love this app it is very good to learn and perfect new languages.,5
instead of starting from the beginning it tells you what your level,4
"BRING BACK STORIES! I am a level B1 Spanish speaker and enjoy going to Duolingo to read the stories. What I do NOT go to Duolingo for is how to conjugate ""we brush our teeth"" into past conditional tense. I don't care that you embedded them in the lessons. This does not help me when I want to read the story where Junior thinks his dad is a lion tamer. This is like when you deleted stories such as the Hernandez Family Curse from the app. Don't you get that we actually enjoy the stories!?",3
best app to learn multi languanges,5
I love it,5
"this app Makes learning a language so fun! And I find this really useful, the app has tons of other languages and is very good at teaching! it's like a game being combined with teaching! I'd say this deserves a 5star review",5
it's incroyable application and she help me a lot in english i am realy obsessed with this application and i love it<3,5
The worst app 🤮,5
Terrible for learning Russian! The very first lesson asks what word you hear but doesn't even explain what sounds the letters and symbols make... How am I supposed to know what word I hear?!,1
Consistently uses my streak freezes even when I know I've done a lesson that day.,1
fun and motivating,5
Duolingo is a big help,5
it is really cool,5
"We are enjoying DuoLingo. I pay for the upgraded family MAX plan. The whole family is learning French together. My only complaint is - while my family members all see transcript of Lily video calls, but I do not. I pay for the subscription, why do I not see the same benefits??! Frustrating.",5
A free app the uses multiple lessons to reinforce it's teachings. It's also game like and very fun to learn.,5
help me learn Korean.,5
it's a super application.,5
Amazing 😍 app so beautiful app❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
Very helpful for me,5
best app ever,5
this is a good app for english beginner.,5
"Duolingo used to be the best language learning app until they changed the way you could earn hearts back. The old way you could practice to earn hearts anytime you were low. This method allowed you to practice a lot. Now you can only earn ONE heart back after they are all gone. This makes it very hard to advance levels. With this option you can't make any mistakes in order to pass to the next level, or use up all your gems. Duolingo changed this to FORCE YOU TO PAY. One star until changed.",1
super,5
very easy to follow,5
Very good free app,1
is so good I love this application so match 🤍🫠,5
❤️,5
Learning Spanish here is so fun! I'm glad my friend recommended this.,5
terrible! I am charged even though I cancelled after 7 day trial! I have written on different sites to no avail! I don't want to recommend the site if my subscription is not cancelled!,4
I'm so excited that I found this app. It seems like I'm never going to catch on but just doing it over and over I think it will sink in..,5
doulingo is hard but its good for beginners who doesnt know languages!,5
very nice,5
"This app is so sigma! (Very good app, learning Spanish and stuff this app is so helpful and good 5 stars!!!)",5
It definitely helps you learn! (At least for Spanish that's the course I chose,5
muito bom TE AMO Duolingo❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
I love the lessons I wish to start speaking Spanish pretty soon Gracia's!,5
Quite engaging in an objective and intelligible form..,5
great and efficient language learning. Arigato Gozaimasu.,5
"This is pretty helpful, and keeps me motivated learning Spanish!",4
too much advertising,3
Such a great app! They make learning fun and engaging...better than a game on your phone and you're actually learning!,5
aplikasinya Bagus dan memebantu bangett,5
It s pretty good,4
I have been using duolingo for 12 days now I think it is a good app for beginners and other levels you had hearts to use up like live when you use all them up they freeze your strike for you to give you a second chance I really like this app!!!,4
super duolingo costumer- very poor expresion consistency on early german lessons.,1
Very good.,5
"It's very good for learning a language but if you try to promote especially in the diamond tournament, there are people who it seems do nothing else but this app they have insane amounts of XP and it's kinda discouraging.",4
"i think this app is so useful,i really enjoy!",5
Stupid to have to know how to spell names of people,4
I don't like how if you don't practice Duolingo it sends you weird messages but it's a good learning process,3
Duo is the best in one week I learned Spanish,5
"I'm unable to access any of it's features. It keeps on telling me that I might be offline, which is not.",1
It is good,4
good platform for learning,5
Amazing,5
"it's really great ,but it will be awesome if add more languages as Persian and improve the quality of Turkish.",5
very good.,5
This app is amazing. It helps my kid learn her mom's heritage.,5
pls don't steal my family:) I love learning Spanish!,5
My most favourite are mini podcast listening exercises,5
i like vary much,5
"I love this app it's so fun.I look forward to doing this every day, but when they asked me to speak the sentence, you have to say it in an accent. Overall, I really love this app and suggest you try it!",4
amazing absolutely amazing way to learn a language,5
Duolingo as everyone already knows is excellent. I've been consistent for a week and I plan to learn Korean in three months.,4
It helped me learn my native language very easily it's really easy to understand.,5
Not boring,5
it a really good app and it keeps up with you like a parent 😅,5
actually helping me trying to read the book that I published that is Korean,5
Its so easy,5
"What I'm a supposed to do with that gems and and fire? And what the purpose of showing meistake right after I did it? Anki works much better, imho",1
cool,5
verry good,5
"Another victim of enshittification, removal of practice to regain hearts is straight up predatory, and makes it so much harder to learn, which is ultimately what this app is for.",1
"duolingo max is very helpful, it explains your mistakes and you can find out how each word fits into sentences properly. would recommend if not for the steep price point",4
"The sound of Confirm/Next button is annoying and too loud, comparing to the sounds of learning letters and sentences. And it's a bit too easy.",2
helped me improve my Italian now I am a teacher at Italy,5
I actually love duolingo!! I just keep pressing refresh hearts and SPENDING 350 GEMS! The hearts should cost less and there should be a button to undo it cause I keep on pressing and I've already lost 700 gems💔,5
It's easy to learn any language It's just perfect,5
I love it,5
Ohh such a great app to learn other languages🌱💞,5
"I've always wanted to learn German, and this app is helping me so much! Slowly but surely, I'll be able to do it!",5
good,5
"Es muy buena, pero las otras versiones super y max, son muy caras. Y antes me dejaba practicar para ganar vidas no importa cuántas fueran, ahora solo puedo practicar para ganar una sola vida, y solo después de haberlas perdido todas.",3
The heart system sucks.. and I can't read the words on the Chinese Lessons because they're either compacted together or is cut in the sides. And I keep getting jump scared by words that are new to me but somehow I've already learned it before?,3
it helped me to learn Japanese 🍙,5
its fun i like it lerning japanes,5
THE BEST!!!,5
El sabe que estoy haciendo mis rachas u.u,5
good,5
a really great language learning app!,5
I wished the notifications would shut up when it's 5 am my time. Has\d to manually configure my tablet to avoid getting them. The lessons are fine. The notifications are horrible,3
easy,4
great,5
"For learning Chineese, good for spelling of pinyin & the Hanzi mix. easy lesson structure. the app feels like a game wich makes it easy to learn. I however do not recomend for Chineese as alot of the pronunciations are incorrect & will make it harder to learn proper. Chineese people will not understand you. After i master Chineese, i will come back to refresh my French & may try some other languages",3
awesome,5
"I really like learning, but in level 4, using correct Grammer is really hard.",4
pretty good love it,5
I love this app,5
"great for everyday language, good set up, easy to learn",5
Really good and fun Ireland different languages,5
really good learning tool just the ads are a bit irritating,5
I learn stuff,5
"Math is math, not a guessing game. Remove the ""get as close as you can"" quiz or whatever the hell it is. Edit: 5 months later and it's still there. Since when mathematics became a guessing game?",1
nice,5
its a good app to use on a daily basis downsides; far to many/frequent adverts it teaches you the language in a more fragmented unfamiliar context to what you learn in a school with little grammar background throughout. I will keep using it,4
very fun and enjoyable lessons.,5
Duolingo are me.,1
PLEASE DUO I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FAMILY IN YEARS,5

so cute and cool,5
Fun and engaging!,5
I already know hot to say basic words in Deutch thank you,5
Wow! learning language made so easy and fun😁 I highly recommend Duolingo 👌,5
I was surprised to see how effectively Duolingo manages to make learning fun. The activities are really educational and interesting - Note: I'm learning only Spanish. So my experience is based on that.,5
"perfect app for learning languages , i learning Russian with this and its very useful and lovely my only problem with this app , its doesn't have persian language and i force to learning Russian with English",5

Me encanta,5
Amazing 👏🏻 🤩,5
this app is so good. Just make you keep you streak or else,5
"Duolingo is a great app for language learners. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn any language, especially if you are a beginner because it's beginner friendly. It gives one the opportunity to learn at their own pace. The streak count also helps one to stay committed to learning.",5
loving it,5
He teaches me quickly and with great fun.,5
it's fun and great,3
This app is excellent for learning English.,5
so much easier to learn any language that you need,5
Owl is funny.,5

"It's a breeze, so easy to follow. Repetition and making notes is key to my ease of learning. Dont over do the learning, rather go over your work rather than chase ahead and forget.",5
it's great but hearts are annoying . . . .,4
Excellent,4
cool,4
its just app for learning,5
It is worth the stay. 🤗 very Educating and concise.🤓,5
Best learning app ever,5
Horrible. Downloaded for my 8 yr old daughter. I selected beginner start from scratch. First off you click on the speaker button and nothing comes out I know its not the tablet because volume works on all her other apps. So then I click forward and it shows a word in Spanish and asks her to click the picture that matches. How is she supposed to know what the word means when it hasnt even taught her a word yet?! I could understand putting the word in English then Spanish....,1
This app is amazing,5
"i met MARTHA and diana,i an incident, sad but ,beautiful witness of God's blessings, miracle of life and healing and new journey for them ,for me to look at it as aray of hope for any situtions. coming to learn spanish, if given a chances to see them or a lottery or my savings to visit them, i can interact better, know thiers culture and beauty of its own meet their family, friends and understand every bit of fun,laughter and jokes... hoping my brains can catchup with this language, thankyou",5

when you want to cancel you have a hard time and to no avail. they charged me $185.00 instead of $167.00 tried canceling before the trial was up,1
it's is best app and learning 👌 enjoying 😉 experience 😀 all best English app duolingo,5
This is a fun app and you can do everything you want totally free. There are some excellent add ons if you want to purchase them but I'm learning Spanish and doing it with my friends without cost. And I am enjoying it.,5
it's really nice,5
Actually it's motivating me to practice daily even if I am tired 😌.,5
best app,3
"Fun game. Great experience. But do note that it won't teach you every aspect of a language. Duolingo is mostly the basics, not more.",4

the best app it really did help me,5
excellent learning tool. I enjoy learning a language with games and lessons. great fun.,5
amazing app good app,5
very useful,5
it has many languages ​​from which we can learn english but there is no urdu option from which we can learn english. it will be very kind if urdu option is also added in it so that we can learn english from urdu۔,2

Very good app,5
A very nice learning app,5
Duolingo helps you relax your mind while learning new things at the same time. It's challenging but fun. Really enjoying it.,5
"It's great app for gamified learning but the pop-ups to spend gems (the in app premium currency) keep appearing over the top of other buttons. In my haste to complete lessons I have unintentionally clicked on buttons to spend gems 1000 multiple times, due to the positioning of these buttons and the lack of a confirmation screen. It's highly infuriating since the rate at which I earn gems for free seems to have tanked recently.",3
"I like this fine for a free learning app but it has some problems. one of them is on some of the lessons the app will glitch out and prevent me from going on when I'm trying to answer the question. the green check bar will not flash green preventing me from going further. They really need to look at there code to see what's wrong. Another problem is showing how a sentence structure works in another language, it just skips some of that and it can hurt your understanding of the language.",3
it's quite great,4
Duo really teach me spanish abd Japanese 🥰,5
👌,5
cool app to learn new languages,4
poggers,4
Great,5

"5 estrelas para preservar a segurança da minha família... Solta meu cachorro Duolingo, eu já compensei a ofensiva da semana passada 😭😭😭",5
Good app,4
Best app of all time,5
"I have been using Duolingo since 2012, for the last decade. It has been an amazing application and experience. Those days are over. Like any other legacy product they are trying to monetize it instead of modernizing it. I was a paid member for a long time and then when they wanted to up my rates by tacking on AI, that was the end of me paying for Duolingo. Since I'm already paying for other AI applications, I have a great experience with them. Improving my Spanish. Bye Duo. Ya got greedy.",1
"Great app! It is a very helpful learning tool and appeals to the newer generations. Sometimes the ads don't load and make me have to reset the app, but overall, it's an awesome app :)",4
"good app, good learning app, thanks",5
"It's ok. I'm learning German and the audio examples are definitely not how real German people talk. Some words are pronounced a certain way and no matter how I say it back the app says I'm wrong. As far as teaching me the basics it'll do, to become proficient (nowhere near fluent) this app won't be any use for teaching how to hold real world conversations.",3
very nice Duolingo,5
onk vlo ekta app,5
bahut enjoy kar rahe hai,5
"Edit: This app now is now focused on puahing Super and Max, punishing you for loosing hearts and only letting you earn 1 heart back instrad of all 5. Super Duolingo is only worth it because we now have no other choice. I've been using Duo for French for over a year. Duolingo is good, it presents good challenges, constantly switches between listening, watching and speaking. However, it doesn't explain all subjects well, which causes me to lose hearts, get stuck, loose streaks.",3
I wish I didn't have to use data for some streaks,4
this is amazing it helps you 😊,5
my Duo has frozen on my ipad,1
great,5
অনেক শব্দ ভান্ডার চাই,5

I think there are too many adverts and that the premium version delivers to little for the price.,3
كويس,4
this app very help to learn language,5
🌼♥️,5
its a very good app for lerning english it doesnt matter if your are a biggener or expert this is really works,5
"The app is awesome but the only problem to why i rate it 3 starts is the lag it has, whenever i have a sentence which only has to two eord to select so as to fill the gaps i can even tap the whole day and those two words to fill the two gaps each and they wont even budge but when i have a sentence which needs translation and there are 4 or 5 words to connext no lagging happens. So pls fix that",3
excellent,5
I am start learning Russian and now i am good in Russian Duolingo is a good app for learning language that's a good app,5

A very good language learning app Nice,5
its good but not great,4
very nice 👍,5
"The app does not work and does not teach. I have cancelled subscription and uninstalled app. I truly regret wasting so much time and money on this app and service. I have purchased actual learning materials. Duolingo is just another company, who wants you to spend money. The are not about education.",1
so fun amd easy to learn. I love it.😍,5
very good. sometimes hard to hear the details of the words spoken,4
good,4
best application,5
"I have been using duolingo for almost an year, I am satisfied with everything, the only issue I have is how a new word is directly in the lessons like, How would I prefer is that first introduce the word with the meaning, and then use that word in different sentences, but what actually is that a new word is directly used in sentences without being introduced and what it means.",4
best learning app,5
"I tried this app for the first time, and luckily I had a good experience. Infact it sounds a great app to learn any language, maths or music. I really love it and wanna practice every day.",5
excellent,5
good app for language learning,5
super😃😃,5
it's really super app very useful,5
New update many times fails to show leaderboard,5
this app is very helpful,5
"Thank you for fixing the December glitch with double points, and for now providing a way to get TRIPLE points! I love the new features and upgraded to the Family Plan. May I suggest a free trial of the newest Max features, specifically the AI Chat feature? I debated whether to upgrade to the Family Plan or the Max Plan, but choose the Family Plan to better involve more of...my family!",5
👍👍,5
"Free user here. Was better when you could practice for hearts to get as many as needed. Now it's only for one when you completely run out, so lessons are at a stop unless you pay or wait hours/day for it to refill (which is inconvenient and makes your motivation die). Also, goal posts keep moving. Only get Duolingo if you can pay. Otherwise, it's not worth your effort as things for free users keep getting worse + It's impossible to compete in leagues with paying users that have unlimited hearts.",2
هاذا التطبيق جميل ل تعلم اللغات,5
good app. I've already learned a little bit in just 4-5 days at only about 5-10 minutes a day.,5
Please include English to Thai,3
i love learning spanish on this app,5
"I love duo, I've been learning norwegian on here for a while and I love their exercises they're super fun and it's like playing a game",5
"so far since I've been on the app it's been great, I've learnt alit in just a short while, although it's kinda annoying when you loose all your hearts but I've come to realize how much it encourages me to study harder and gain more hearts. overall I think it's a fantastic app",4
this perfect it's like playing games,5
"Hey Duo, I want to give you some feedback. You should add a section in your app where a 4v4 team is randomly or knowingly formed, and all players are learning the same language. The game will work like this: A vocabulary word will be given in a foreign language, and everyone must choose its meaning in their native language within a second. If all squad members correctly guess the meaning, they will earn points. In the end, the team with the highest points will win.",5
Duo lingo has been easy to learn and fun. Trying Japanese now!,5
"Best language learning app ,all kidnapping aside. Seriously this app is such user friendly, and l wanna tell you a story how l know Latin, l'm an Indian, who can understand, Japanese & Latin all because of Duolingo ,first l was only learning Japanese and tought well, first let's finish learning Japanese then we'll go to next language, took me 663 days to realize learning never ends ,after learning [still learning] Japanese 663 days ,l also started studying Latin, just in case [exorcism😊]",5

it teaches our kids to learn,5
ok ok,5
"It's very useful and easy to learn , Duolingo is so cute",5
Very great if you want to learn a new language. It gives different kinds of questions and let you try again if you get it incorrect.,4
It's good but needs some fixes like the recording of our voice in some exercises,4
"Although the app is very good, it would be better for all translations to be in English. Some are in American using words that aren't correct in English.",4
The app is normal but the Duolingo channel ☠️,5
Very great app to learn languages,5

I love Duolingo so much! I am learning languages fast and easily. It is really easy to sign up and get started. I would personally recommend this to anybody wanting to start learning new languages.,5
"learned a lot and was fun. There were lots of ads, though",4
"Probably leaving the app soon. The removal of practice lessons to increase hearts (allowing me to keep going when I'm in the brainspace for it) feels like pushing me to super, and the quality just isn't good enough to bother with that.",1
it's great and teaches me better than my teacher,5
is very nice game 🤗🤗 🫢🤗 🤫🤗,5
very nice aap learn for bigger,5
this app is very good and very helpful 👏🏻,5
it's such a amazing app I learn lots of things from this app,5
This is the best language learning app,5
"It's perfect for absolute beginners. The app slowly introduces one to new words gradually, and that's good for new learners",5
والله تطبيق ممتاز، بس أهم شي الإستمرار عليه,5
👍👍👍,5
Used to be amazing but last few weeks you camt see the leaderboard. Bugs need fixing and app keeps glitching. Happening wih multiple people I know. It's not just a problem wih my device. Cant my the feed either. No recorded progress of my top finishes in the leaderboard. Puts people off as it isnt competitive anymore,3
best app,5

very good option for learning a language,5
Great app for learning languages,5
"The app is great, and I love using it, but I'm tired of watching ads for extra gems, seeing my total gems go up in that window, and then watch the total go back down when I close out of the ad. It doesn't happen consistently, but enough that I'm annoyed by it. I also got shorted 100 gems recently when I completed something big. Those gems vanished when my daily progress screen popped up over it. Please fix this!",2
yaxshi,4
It's very useful app . Thanks Duolingo for improving my English spoken,5

"Best language learning tool, that I've found yet!",5
this is good app this best languages,5
"This app is very helpful,, i really enjoy this app... Thankyou owner💝🥰",5
it's a great educational app.,5
Best app to learn languages NGL.,5
"The main problem is that if you keep practicing, the app will overwhelm you with new material instead of new exercises about topics you were already learning. One day it was one new word to another, 75 in total, or grammar concepts with no clear explanations on how to use them. It should reinforce the previous learning a lot more before advancing. In music, you're rushed as well in new topics and in speed when the app hasn't really prepared you for that. Very frustrating! I think I'll quit music",3

"An ad is fine. A promo for the paid service is fine. Both an ad and a ""sign up for our subscription service"" after *every* lesson tells me management is worried about the stock price for the next quarter and doesn't care about the long-term health of the company or about the user experience. If another app comes out that has less intrusive get-money interruptions I'm done.",2

Duolingo is the most creative application for learning any language.Duolingo look like your private tutor.If you spend just only 5 minute every day in duolingo then 5 month later you improve your any language skill.,4
The best learning App.,5
where was all this time 🥰🥰🥰,5
"This app has good potential. They make it fun and have ways to motivate you to continue learning each day. However, after about 146 days of using the app (doing at least one lesson per day) I am uninstalling Duolingo. This app has an ad supported model but you can pay a premium which removes them (maybe) and gives you access to addition features (unnecessary). I'm not against any of that, however the ads are 90+% self advertising the premium features. I am over watching the same ad for 146 days",3
"so good like I'm leaning German and I'm already able to talk kaffe und milch, bitte",5
this app is very good,5
Too much ads but still love the App and Ilso I'm on the 73 streak on it 😍,4
good,5
تطبيق حلو تقدر تتعلم فيه كثير من لغات بطريقة مسلية بس فيه مشكلة واحدة هي ان رح يكون عندك 5 قلوب و هادي قلوب تنقس عندما في سؤال وإذا سار عدد قلوبك صفر فما راح تقدر تكمل في درس وبعد مدة راح يعطوك قلب واحد وتقدر تدفع 500 جوهرة مقابل 5 قلوب أو تدفع فلوس حقيقية وراح يصير عندك قلوب لا نهائية وهذه مشكلة بس يستاهل تطبيق تقييم 4 نجوم,4

the best app where you can learn a language,5
"nice I like it, I wanted to learn more thank you 😊❤️",5

It honestly is a great app to learn a new language from. They make it easy to learn with the lessons and challenges they give as you learn.,5

divos total,5
"Painfull. I feel like I downloaded duolingo 10 years ago. Back then it was an amazing app, It played with your brain and tricked you into learning new language. I believe you would learn 5 new word per lesson with the repeat ance of previously earned words. Today, It feels like people who created the app are no longer associated with it. It was bought by greedy monsters who would sell their own mother to you. It is just repeating the same words you used, and giving you useless points",1
ads,3

Duo makes it easier to learn any language..as it breaks down your learning stages in system that is comfortable for beginners and advanced student alike...so happy to have duolingo.,5
"After many years I came back to Duolingo to learn Turkish. Feedback after 3 weeks of daily learning. Pro: it is fun, gamification keep me motivated, I learn something new. Con: Voice is just text to speech like google Translator, no real voice actors, no grammar rules explained, no key concepts of the language explained like vovel harmony or suffixes, not the same kind of practices available as for English/Spanish... Summary: Nice for introduction of the language but you need more tools to learn",4
Duolingo is good.,5
"very helpful , it is very easy to learn hindi know",5
l love it,5
The best app to learn a lot of things me personally think that Duolingo is sharp and kinda angry to be honest I like it,4

"Seems to have intensified the gamification lately to the detriment of the learning. This is done with point multipliers making staying on the leader board all about knowing how to get the most points rather than about spending time learning. Despite this focus, the boosts often fail to apply which is intensely frustrating.",3
দারুন ❤️❤️❤️❤️,3
It is not letting me to open the app,5

"Its ok, having learned different languages before. This app spends a little too much time on the spelling of words than it does actually speaking and learning grammar of the language you are learning. I mean if anyone is dyslexic you will never learn anything on this app.",3

I used to love Duolingo (and recommended you to friends), but not being able to see my points and also I can only do 1 revision lesson and gain 1 heart at a time (then have to wait 5 hours for another heart or do another revision lesson to get only 1 heart). One used to be able to do revision and get 5 hearts. This way I will never be able to learn French!",5

"Since I paid for a yearly subscription, it's gradually become more and more unstable, plus they continue to cut functionality. Update. Lowering the rating to 1 because the gamification bugs make me hate it.",1

🥰🥰🥰 🌹🌹🌹,4
"My leader board won't load, any ideas? I've uninstall, cleared caches etc.",3
1 star because Duolingo has turned into another app that requires payment to enjoy. If you don't spend real money you will be sitting there watching advertisements all day. You'll never win in the rankings. It's rigged. Don't spend a single pennie here. They don't deserve it. Fun apps that are fair deserve money. This is far from either.,1
love it,5
app is very good 💯,4
it is helpful,4
it is very useful app to learn language,5

"Doulingo is a absolutely a perfect app for learning and I appreciate the new updates that have games and more lessons. But one of the problems of the new update is when you got all your hearts gone from mistakes, you can't bring them back with learning again. And I hate it. So please bring it back, it's not easy to spend all your gems or wait all the day long for getting hearts back!!! Thank you.",4
very nice app,4

"현재 프랑스어를 한국어로 배우고 있습니다. 그런데 불편한 점이 한 가지 있는데요. '공부해요'와 '공부합니다'는 한국어에서 똑같은 높임말이고, 높임말을 번역할 때 무엇을 택하든 위화감이 없는데 둘 중 하나를 고른다고 해서 오답 처리를 하는 것은 아닌 것 같아요. 한국어로 된 정답을 처리할 때 좀 더 세밀하게 과정이 짜여있으면 좋을 것 같아요.",4

"Duolingo makes it fun to practice a language but it's really hard and confusing if you don't already have an actual class for that language. For example I have an in person Spanish class and Duolingo is a good way to practice and review what I learn in my class, but I also tried learning other languages like Norwegian and Russian but it was really challenging.",4

super app,5
very good app to learn new language,5
App said it would remind me 2 days before my free trial was over. App never reminded me and I was charged for a year. I believe Duolingo does this as it knows the chances are high that Google will not refund so no reminder and the person does not cancel and that get money. I can't recommend Duolingo based solely on this issue I have had not happy.,1
This app is very helpful for learn english,5

"Too many adds! Sometimes, you're quizzed on things you haven't learned yet. I don't feel I can hold a conversation as well as I feel I should by now. Following a conversation in real life should be better, too. I like that math and music are available as well as a variety languages. I don't like the competition aspect so much anymore. At first, it wasn't bad, but I'm over that. You should be able to opt out of that... maybe you can, idk.",3

"overall pretty good, ads get annoying, and the game can get stressful. Especially with streaks, it's very pressuring sometimes and freaks me out when I don't have enough gems for streak freezes and I'm having a tough day. Also, it's not so good at teaching sentence structure for different languages, you sort of just have to figure it out. But in general this app is fine for learning languages or any other course.",4

As part of all languages, I feel that a grammar section of the course could really help those learning to understand as to why, when translated, it is said a different way.",4
it is amazing now I am in Japan talking to everyone!,5
"Great! I started only yesterday, but I am learning Vietnamese, Too late kj!",5
The app is very very good,5
I have learned more here than my french teacher could,5
Good tool. Shame they got greedy and started charging a ridiculous amount.,3
LOVE IT 1. now I'm learning Korean for free! 2. yea the ads are annoying for the hearts and stuff 3. ASOME APP,5
I love this app it is so funny and cute and fun,5
amazing app definitely suggest,5
really helpful Spanish,5
Add Bangla language,1
It helps to make me learn faster keep it up Duolingo .Thanks 🙂🙂🙂😀😃😄💗,5
"The language teaching is good. The whole experience is let down by an interface designed for 12 year olds. No i don't want to play games. No i don't want a free trial of Super. Why can you not publish a straight price for subscriptions? Instead you want people to take the ""free trial"" hoping they will forget to cancel and you can charge them. I would be happy to pay if you didn't hide behind this nonsense.",1
would recommend using.,4
good app,5
it's a good app but..... when you run out of hearts then you have to buy it or do a challenge,3
The best,5
تحفههههه من اجمل البرامج بجد لتعليم اللغه,5
super cute and sweet games,5
Simple and repetitive learning exercises help build vocabulary.,5
it's cool,5
it's Amazing! I'm learning Duolingo and I barely made any mistakes!,5
"good language learning app, but pls duolingo pls when I forget my streak don't kill me",4
neat ain't bad,4
disappointed with changes in the program which are aimed at trying to push you into having a paid account,3
very useful,5
nice 👍👍👍👍,5
بكل صراحه طريقه جدا سهل لي تعلم اللغه ☺️,5
not bad😍,5
"nowhere near speaking a second language, but it helps to learn slowly which thus app does",5
Good to learn languahes if you are travelling or just want to waste time productively instead of brain-dead scrolling through tiktok.,5
It is easy to learn a foreign language,5
I like the app is not bad for a app but it better to take classes.,4
I love duolingo it's one if the best free ways to learn languages I find that the streak helps motivate me to do it everyday. It's also helpful that they added the ability to do your lessons offline tonight ir could use a little improvement it's still a very good app,5
very nice app,5
easy to learn,5
its very educational and i love it!,5
Live laugh love duolingo 🫶🏻,5
it's challenging and fun. I really enjoy my daily appointments with Duo,5
"I really wish everytime i get a 2xp it wouldnt activate the moment i accept it, yet instead activate the moment i start my next lesson.. That way between lessons the 2xp doesnt run out while im busy doing other things. It seems everytime i get a 2xp for completing a lesson, it runs out during the time i have set down my phone to take care of my kids or help mother with things, ya know, life. So please will you change the 2xp to start when the lesson does. And not when accepted. I'd Preciatechya❤",5
❤️,5
So 😎 🆒️,4
goooooooood,5
helpful application,5
Great 👍,5
So perfect app ❤️❤️❤️🇳🇬 I love this app,5
I think dulling is fun u should ty it,5
Una aplicación increíble para aprender y practicar un idioma,5
super fun and easy to learn,5
"The methodology (learning through repetition) is effective, and the delivery is fun. However, the app itself is frustratingly glitchy.",4
I learned a lot,5
Nice for beginners,5
I think it is a good app because it can help me with any language.,5
fun way of learning,3
this is just a great app for me. you can learn any languages you wanted,5
"nice, I'm making great progress. my problem is, in the Hebrew course, there's no rendering sound when you go into the review section and try to revise the learnt vocab.",4
The best app for language learning,5
For every 10 seconds actually using the app you have like 1 minute of ads. And the app is not worth the payment.,1
What a excellent application 👏 👏,5
It's really good and it's really helping me at school the only problem is for me is that whenever a word has two meanings it makes you learn both which is strange since it's sometimes completely unrelated,4
amo lo didactico que es. es perfecto paea mantenerse motivado y aprender idiomas!!!!,5
good,5
very good thought it's better on PC,5
amazing,5
it's a good app for me 😎👍,5

I love learning with this app,5
it's amazing no complaints,5
applikasi nya bener bener ngebantu aku buat belajar bahasa lain,5
The best Language learning app so far.. Learning a new language has never been this fun and super easy!,5
Way too many notifications and to learn why you got something wrong you have to pay extra even though you bought a subscription. Been using Duo for a year and I learned some spanish but not enough to hold a conversation.,2
"almost perfect, not a fan of the lives system that you have to watch add to keep learning but that's about it.",4
wanderf app,5
Good,5
Amazing to learn lots of language's,4
It's great if you want to learn how to be able to understand what phrases are but it's not really going to teach you how to say it because it's mostly just teaching you what each phrase means you ain't going to become fluent in it or really learn how to actually say it but it's pretty good overall app if you want to try to learn whatever language,4
it's a good app for learning German:),5
One of the best app to learn any language. Duolingo is,5
Amazing language practice 👏,5
love the app I'm learning Japanese and it's really fun they really know how to keep people entertained,5
fun to learn new language,5
The streak repeats again over and over I need help duolingo,3

"it's an amazing learning languages lesson app, I love their YouTube channel it's very very funny it's educational and if you want to learn any language you can and that's for your music to me XOXO❤️",5
"Amazing & wonderful app, which helps us to learn different languages",5
I had too he is out side my windows 🟢🦉,5
Very good for learning different languages,5
This is an amazing app for learning new languages you would think it would cost money but even if you don't pay like me you still get an amazing app,5
pretty easy so far i just started learning korean so yeahh and also 5 stars or else duo will track my location and take my family away. LOVE U DUO!,5
This app is the best language learning app I ever encounter. I got to learn so much Japanese and I can know understand some words and phrases.(Btw I am still learning.) Duolingo makes learning a language fun. I recommend in using this app.,5
i love it i like german,5
Great for learning. My whole family is using it . My 6 year old loves competing for 1st place every week.,5
"I've been using the app (with plus subscription) for quite some time now, but the intense chasing and constant reminders are becoming quite annoying and border-line abusive. I'm in fact considering deleting the app for this reason alone. I understand you want to keep your audience engaged, but please don't add unnecessary stress to people mental balance.",2
Great fun and learning,4
"I've already used it for a week, and i'm having more fun than I thought I would. Great colors and images.",5
It is a very good app I recommend this app if you want to learn a new language,5
it's app good 😊,5
it might not be the most effective for time spent but I can't really tolerate those and I've learned a lot with just a bit of daily practice.,5
is soo good but can you put African language please 🙏,5
ich liebe es,5
Lesedi Benjamin. Duolingo has to be the best tutor when it comes to helping people out to learn foreign language,5
"About 2 years ago I unlocked all the stories for the Japanese course I'm taking. Now I'm not able to access any of the. When I go to the stories section all I see is ""Stories will appear here as you complete them"" but there's no where to see the stories before completing. I complained and nothing has been done, very poor customer service. Till now I haven't had access to the stories",1
"it's so good , I learned English language",5
"They keep ""updating things"" but just make things worse....if I am already paying you money, stop trying to force me into paying another £10 a month. Stop messing with the setup, it's not an improvement. Stop saying come back tomorrow for 3x XP, and even sending notifications to remind me then not allowing it. If this is your idea of improving something, please look up the definition of improving and then once you understand work on fixing stuff rather than making things worse...",2
Duolingo is the best 👌 very good,5
🙂👍,5
Nice,5
really it's good 😊,5
"The free version is unusable especially when exercises become more difficult. Also, no tips on grammar when you get something wrong (locked behind the ultra expensive Max tier).",3
A good way to learn another language. I can't believe it's free.,4
too many stupid games to do to progress,2
"Was a Super subscriber after an hour of using the app. Was on an 1100 day streak. Then recently they launched Max. Max is a premium service that costs TRIPLE what the Super subscription costs. It just comes with some AI lesson stuff, but to sell it they decided to remove the ""Explain my Mistake"" from both the Free AND Super tiers. basically making the ability to learn effectively locked behind a 180/yr subscription. AMAZON isn't even that much. it's greedy, predatory, and lost them my business",1
"Duolingo sangat membantu aku untuk belajar bahasa inggris,kini karena duolingo nilai bahasa inggris ku menjadi meningkat drastis,terimakasi duolingo👍👍",5
hundret percent free app to learn languages. it is called humanity by founders. i love it and support you guys who created and running this idea,5
i love it ..try learning with a friend,5
money hungry ads,1
Don’t have croatian language learning option,1
It's actually pretty great,5
"I think that depending on language, usage, and level of time on task this is a very good Starting Point for a foreign language. I would not try to read Don Quixote in Portugeuse on Day 1...",5
perfect 👌,5
"it does not explain when to use gli, le or il in many cases. I have to ask Italian friends.",3
"EASY! If you practice going over what you learn after each lesson, you'll speak with ease. Bueno!",5
incredible!,5
I believe it's very good app for various language learning by themselves,5
my best. can we learn a text and explain it. with questions and writing topic. listening and answering questions...best luck,4
I give 5 star because I just love the app and also if possible if they can give or enhance our reading ability. Nevertheless it is a very good app. Merci beaucoup guys!,5
Add back the feature to practice for hearts. Also while learning Japanese could you add a feature to turn off it showing the hiragana or katakana over kanji?,2
"The ads have gotten quite bad, with fake 'close' symbols and the like. Also the content of some of the ads has gotten quite borderline (I often do the lessons with my kids with me). Would be great if Duolingo could do a review of what advertisers are using their platform to peddle.",2
help full,5
amazing 😍🤩🤩🤩🤩,5
good,5
nice app,5
He hasn't taken my family... Yet... UPDATE: he took my family,5
banging ☆,5
"wow 👌 it's great amazing and easy understandable app I enjoy how it teaches me and test practice lessons.! better than me, a physical classroom",5
I got quite a ways into the program and then my screen turned black on me.,4
"para hacer preguntas de oraciones, primero de Vocabulario. por ejemplo, Vikran et sa femme priti don't a ??",3
"I'm learning music which has been useful to learn how to read music. However some of the exercises expect the user to play notes at a fast pace before being given a chance to play them at slow speed, which makes the exercise impossible to do and rather pointless. Fortunately this issue does not occur too often.",4
Definitely worth it,5
excellent language learning app and easy to use .... DUO for a reason,5
is so good app I like it if I can give it 10/10 I will do that,5
perfect,5
Simply incredible! An amazing and fun way to learn a new language!,5

"jeg tror det virker flott, jeg mener, jeg har brukt det for å lære norsk og se hvor flinke jeg har blitt, selvfølgelig er Duolingo ikke den hoved grunnen, hoved grunnen er eksponering, men Duolingo hjelper litt og er morsom og nå bruker jeg det for å lære tysk ;)",5
that's boring after some times,2
helped learn Korean,5
really fun and enjoyable!!😁,5
Love this app!,5
"I didn't know anything in Korean, but when I started to learn with duolingo, everything changed. you are the best language learning app!!!",5
I like it very much,4
"very unfair you have to pay the full year up front! if you choose monthly, then you are charged more.",3
Imagine a language learning app tries to collect more information than any other company's app including facebook,1
I love learning polish,5
Wish I Had Music & Math,2
"convenient, constructive and fun learning experience",5
It's a good app if you want to develop a vocabulary in the subject u want to learn but u won't really learn the language to where you can speak it full. Still a very nicely developed app though.a,5

"'Free' version has too many ads, and losing hearts is annoying when it asks you if you want to buy more. Buy more? I've paid for them by watching all those ads, surely? I might try the super version. If they could integrate microphone and mark your pronunciation, it would be good.",2
Ahora puedo hablar en español I have learnt that in this game,5
logical learning progressions,5

"I used to really enjoy learning from this App but the new changes are ruining it for me. Ads after every lesson, Made it really hard to Upload a profile pic which u can't even see when u click on it, many of the default features are now behind a paywall like unlimited hearts, participating in events like Match madness now costs 30 gems FOR EACH LEVEL. I wish they Made new features or cosmetics to promote Super rather than taking away features from Free users.",1
nice,5
fun and easy. give it a try,5

"I had given this app 5 stars, but now I would give it 0 if i could. It is trash. If you make a mistake, they take a heart. You only have five hearts. You used to be able to re-earn those hearts by practicing, but now you can only get one back. This is an education app, and it limits your ability to learn and practice what you're learning? There is something wrong with that. Seriously!!! Needless to say, I closed my account and said screw this and went elsewhere. I suggest you do as well.",1
This is a fun game to play with an extra 5 or 10 minutes at a time. Plus i feel like I'm learning.,5
perfect,4

"In my opinion the app is very good, its fun and has actually help me learn French! I do take an issue with the new heart system though; before you could do a lesson to get a heart, and now it only let's you get one heart if you have no hearts. I always liked that you could practice to continue learning but if you wana do more than a few lessons without getting to 0. I think they should have had longer practice lessons and/or made practice get you 3 hearts(a healthy 2 mistakes) OVER ALL AMAZING",4

"It *was* a great way to keep sharp on Spanish but since duo laid off replaced workers with AI, & are becoming more and more predatory and profit focused, Duo has fallen and failed by becoming greedy. I hope the idiotic leadership in charge understand that they are the problem, and the app was just fine before they decided they were entitled to more. Bring back practice for hearts. Bring back practice for hearts. Bring back practice for hearts. Bring back practice for hearts. 0 stars. Trash app.",1

"it's a simple, 100%, free app, it works great, I'm doing German, and it's really simple, close to English, but if your learning to speak to other family members, that don't speak your language, use Duolingo, it's a reliable source",5

"January 2025 and I am updating my review. Please allow friends studying the same language to chat. Bring in chat in the app so that learners can converse. It will strongly boost language learning. (Addition) Allow users to find native users and learn together. Example: I am studying French but I understand English. Another person is studying English but understandds French, you must find a way to link these kind of people. That way it boost their language usage and learning.",5

App UX itself is quite good but content is rubish",1
"This app is very useful. You can learn many new words in any language you want and it's free. Also, it has an interesting method of attracting enthusiasts and you will keep studying by its day streak. I highly recommend this app, especially for teenagers.",5

"Removing the friendly and helpful forums to shove constantly incorrect and unreliable AI generated answers when you had native speakers providing informative nuanced answers that it's not possible for AI to do sounds like a bad idea if your goal is, truly, to help people learn a language. But of course, language learning is not the goal. It's a publicly traded company so it's goal is to make you spend money for a consistently worse quality product.",1

"The new UI/UX is bad, or worst. And also I couldn't access the listening lesson anymore in the Japanese course which is really helpful.",5
good,5
"In the beginning I learned a lot from using Duolingo. But with the constant updates and changes to courses I find it difficult to make progress. The update for 2023/10/01 moved me back to unit 7 from unit 10. It not motivating me to learn and progress. With the changing of the course materials, I was forced to start all over again, because I missed words/phrases that is repeated in new lessons.",1

"Sick of ads or being asked to add notifications or things to my home screen.. Even though I pay for premium. I ALREADY PAY FOR YOUR SERVICE. leave it at that, stop trying to get me to add more notifications, which I also have all turned off. Also, Korean course sucks compared to German and French etc. It's just direct translation over and over and over",4

Very good app to learn new languages at your free time,5
It's really good you can understand easily and I'm improving a lot too,5
nice,5
Some of the pronunciations don't sound the same within the same lesson. It is not consistent. It is better to see lips move as well for better training or the person trying to speak the learned launguage will be looking down like they are doing when learning the lesson on the phone or device. I am enjoying the app but only had 2 days of this and see the limitations of learning an additional language.,3
it's a good app for improving your vocabulary.,3
good 👍,5
Duolingo is Best programm,5

"I love this app! I learned Spanish from being in the Dominican Republic from 2018 to 2020 and this app has helped me to keep my Spanish sharp. I use Spanish at work and on occasion in my personal life so this is super helpful. I did the entire Italian course so I can speak that now which is nice and I'm working on Indonesian so that I can speak with a friend that knows Malay. This app is super helpful and does a good job at keeping you motivated. So much better than Rosetta Stone,and free too!",5

it helps me learn a lot of words its good for learning spainish!,5
❤️☺️,5
Duolingo is great. Although after finishing a language (Turkish I did) it just repeats the latest courses. For months it just gets me repeated lessons in daily refresh and If you yourself review old lessons it does not reward you enough gems to keep you in your current league. Please fix this issue.,5
"If you think paid version is better - no: - same stupid content about elephants eating sandwiches - once you finish the topic you need to repeat it to remember, but repetition block in next topic seems to be completely random, saying that words like ""gradpa"" are weak for me (spoiler - no), but never touching the words I indeed completely forgot - listening section repeats last 3-4 topis and that's it If you are serious about learning a language 100€ will buy you two textbooks for self study",1
good app 👌❤️,5
i'm thankful to youtube and to duolingo because now i know some languages i know japan languages now i'm play this game for two days in a row and this day i finally did it,5

Thank You your Seaport 🫶,5
it's every good I love it,5
I really enjoy the updated app because they've now included games. However I have to go back to the previous lessons to play them all. They're neat!! Only downside is that there's been lots of times I go back to the lessons and they've inserted words I've never learned...and it's Unit 2 and I'm all the way in Unit 4. So now I have to go back through to see what they updated. As for learning...I mostly know how to listen & understand but actually responding or saying something back. No clue....,4
it Is the best app for learning 👌,5
doulingo🔥🔥🔥,5
"I find it a very great app, makes it easy to learn different languages and the competitiveness is kind of encouraging",5

This is an amazing app for every student,5
This app is so good and I am happy to use this app,5
"I get more gamer rage from this than actual games - it gets so discouraging! the most recent frustrations are how they place the ""use gems?"" button right over the submit button during fast paced lessons which then triggers your earned gems to be used. Surely this is on purpose in attempts to get you to switch to their paid programs for ""unlimited"" gems?!",1
It's a great tool for beginners to use to learn Spanish. I'm excited to learn new words daily and to increase my vocabulary. Thank you duolingo!,5
good,5
nice,4
perfect for paying for the bus ride,5
My only gripe is theirs no monthly family plan. If it was 20 bucks a month it be worth it. I got kids can't drop 70 bucks on something like this.,5

"I'm not entirely certain what I can add that others have not said already. I chose to learn Welsh (again), as I've failed in the past via other methods and apps. Thus far, I've already done much better than I have in the past. Albeit, on a VERY basic level. But, I'm only just shy of a month trying. It moves a little too fast for me. And it's nearly impossible for me to figure out how to just pay one month at a time. Obvs on purpose.",4
good app,5
BRO IM SAYING ETUDIE AND YOUR DUO THING ISNT PICKING IT UP LIKE IM SAYING IT AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IN THEIR TONE FOR IT TO PICK UP FIX IT,3

Great app. would be good to improve the language used. Which is overly formal and better for written language than conversational. This outdated. The Japanese and Korean languages used are like a commoner speaking to the King and Queen.,3

"I still can't get over how I lost my 172 day streak even though I did my lesson at around 3:46 pm. Besides that I think that this is a great way to learn a new language and to improve your math and/or music. Something that I would like Duolingo to do is that after every unit you have a ""test"" about all the words/phrases/sentences you have learned in that unit. Those are the reasons why I give Duolingo a 4 out of 5 star rating!",4
Very useful,5
it's like a game where you can learn from:D,4
One of the frustrating thing about duolingo is until now they havent solve the problem in my account. Like i already sent multiple report to them but until now there is no progress. Annoying.,1
"amazing app, helps me learn to perfection!",5

good app,5
good,4
bahut badiya,4
easy learning!,5
Good 😉,5
I feel like they need to explain the alphabet more,5
"I feel like the app just pressures you to advance as far as possible and not actually strengthen the words you struggle with. I'm trying to learn the differences between all the nestas, dessas daqueles, naqueles, (there are like 28 different ways to say these and those in portuguese), etc. and the app doesn't welcome the option to practice specific words. I think the app needs an option to practice specific groups of words over and over. Maybe an option by the flag button to return to it?",3
this app has a very big impact for my life.,5
God apps,5
good english learning app,4

"GIVE BACK THE PRACTICE TO EARN HEARTS. This app used to be great I had given a 5 star review in the past it used to be a real tool to learn a language for free. Now its completely suffocating for the free user making it an extremely frustrating experience if you dont pay. Its a shame, this app had a great potential and during years it was the best option to learn languages.",1

I'd say more but this is enough, ciao!",2
The best,5
Great English Learning App......If you want to learn other language with enjoy then obviously I'll recommend this App.,5
Best,5
Used to enjoy this app but the new update is awful. I've lost most of the stories I had unlocked and with no way to get them back. Change it back.,4
I'm re-learning spanish after many years of having not used it and forgetting it. Duolingo is making it easy and fun.,5
no farsi language! too many ads.,3
it is worth downloading,5
very fantastic language lerning app,5
I love the flexibility of lessons and the engaging content. I have a very busy schedule but always try to find time to practice a little every day.,5
I know nothing about Spanish until I downloaded Duolingo and so far I can write or say a sentence in Spanish,4
a great app,5
Please can you give me a more difficult exercises,5
"love the app. I am currently on the trial period learning Japanese. It's a great way to start learning a language as they tackle speaking, sight words, translations, etc, all in one app.",5
"It has stopped recording my daily quests. Also, You will always need other language resources.",1
Awesome,5
It will teach you fake things except Spanish,1
"Es imposible tener lecciones con esa cantidad de anuncios, por cada lección finalizada ponen dos anuncios",1
"Really annoying that the app won't explain grammar rules or why something is wrong unless you pay for the premium version, it's just ""right"" or ""wrong"".",2
good,5
"es una app muy buena, accesible y puedes interactuar muy bien",5
I think that Duolingo is a really good app And duolingo can help you to learn a new language,5
"The overall app is fine. They game-ify learning to make it easy to form habits and do a few lessons a day. Building up a little as you go. But the enshitification is real. They are atrocious with their advertisements now, and they have crippled the ability to earn back hearts, making the free version practically unusable at this point. If you can afford the subscription, the app is great. But Duolingo no longer cares about making learning fun and free for everyone. And that really sucks.",3
I love this so much I use it every day and it helped me with my Spanish I really think people should get this,5
this app has made learning a new language easier,5
"Useless, inaccurate and full of ads",1
"gran opción para idiomas, sus publicidades no son repetitivas",5
very fun and easy to understand,5
"Looks like the updates are at it again. Offers you double or triple points, for 10 mins, but doesn't actually give them & just gives the standard 25.",2
Great app to learn languages,5
soo good you will learn fast,5
This app makes it perfect for learning a language at your own pace. It's definitely good for you if you want to challenge your mind.,5
so good to learn anything language,5
"I think... This app is very helpful, so far. But the streak is something that they want us to continue, like when we wanna stop, but we don't wanna lose the streak. Overall, I really like this app, thanks to Duolingo. I really want to travel, and go to Korea, and learn there language. Thank you Duolingo!",4
"not bad, it's kinda fun but idk why✨✨✨",4
"My husband invited my daughters and me to join his family plan so we did. Even though my account is set to public and all permissions are correct, my account still shows up as private. Theirs work fine. I can't follow anyone and no one can follow me. It's so lonely. Please fix this, Duo. I have sent several emails and haven't heard anything from Duo. I like the app and would rate it higher, but I'm just too sad and alone. Please help me, Duo.",2
I love the new update so much,4
it's very fun and easy to use I love it al lot and users can learn any language they want,4
Good thanks,4

Great app - simple and informative,5
Great learning and great fun!,5
it's great I can tork to my mum in Russian,5
love learning,5
"Duolingo staff use AI to generate potential questions, but this is really bad when they don't check the suggestions properly. App often expects you to write or select endings for words it hasn't introduced you to yet. Esp bad in Spanish Stage 2 Unit 3, but occurs in lots of other units. Just had a legendary level ask me about words I've never met even though legendary is meant to be a revision level",1
so far so good,5
I'm going back,5
works great and is good casual instead of other mobile games.,5
So far I like this app.,5
Too many ads,2
"honestly, it's relaxing and educational at the same time and fun, so why not play instead of video games that aren't educational at all and even mess with your health while Duolingo is fun relaxing and much better play it, and I'd you don't stop your motivation will keeps you going.",5
"Amazing, it still sucks that they added the limited hearts, I preferred when they didn't have any hearts",5
im learning but at what cost?,4
Very easy to use 👌,5
Very hard but actually helps very much I Learned so much from this Duolingo,5
I've been learning Spanish it's been great and fun.,5
yep it is good,5
"I used to really love Duolingo. I signed up for Super Duolingo again in the new year because there was a promotion; thought that would give me access to explanations etc., but it really gives you nothing except unlimited hearts and no ads... you have to FURTHER upgrade to Duolingo Max to actually have access to any of the useful features. This used to be included in the Super Duolingo subscription. Cash grab, and definitely not worth it.",2
Challenging yet easy way to learn a new language.,5
German is fun and this is great,5
its good for learning intermediate english ands its fun to use for learning languages,5
Its a nice app,5
really good app to learn from scrath i love this,5
Need to fix xp farming glitches,1
awesome,5
Too many ads.,2
I love it it is a fun way of learning,5
"Comprei o Plano premium de R$ 143,00 e nāo atualizaram a minha conta, entāo fiz o cancelamento do pagamento em menos de 24hs e tambem nāo estornaram no cartāo de credito. Pensem bem sobre outras opções.",5
"I learned some language like japanese, Korean, and etc I like this an I m always updated every day to learn different languages thank you for teaching me learn different languages I'm from the Philippines 🇵🇭",5
able to stay focused and absorb because it's fun,5
Enjoying learning with Duo!,5
it helped my daughter learn Spanish just for fun and at first it started her off with simple words and she got the hang of it after about 2 weeks,5
This is fun. It's like a game. I'm learning a lot.,5
my hanzi classes are annoying.... must there be a one way pattern to write hanzi,4
loving it. so easy to learn,5
"ITS AMAZING! and super fast! I've been learning Japanese and i now know so much! thanks to duolingo I've been able to actually talk to Japanese people for the first time!its also kid friendly, I recommend it if you want to learn another language.",5
awesome way to learn or relearn languages and other topics like math or music!,5
Great game the only wish is that you can speed up on gaining hearts.,4
تطبيق مهم لقد تعلمت منه اللغة الفرنسية هو تطبيق لطيف و جميل جداً,5
I know Spanish now,5
"Each I do a listening lesson and I get awarded 60 or 90XP, the app only adds 25XP to my total XP. I've seen this play out over and over again.",1
awesome👍👍👍👏👏😊😊,5
Very useful ways to learn almost any language!,5
in love with this app,5
great learning app. wish there wasn't no limitation to how many mistakes you got.,4
"The app is honestly amazing helping me pick up and remember vocab, but there were just too many ads promoting super duolingo and duolingo max. It is always the same video and it's very repetitive and boring. I feel like to improve they can have less ads about the super duolingo or none variety in the promotion videos.",4
"Since they removed the option to 'practice to earn hearts', unless you pay for the subscription you are so limited with the amount you can do daily. You can only 'earn' 1 heart now, and even then only when you have no hearts lesf. Refilling the hearts also takes over 24 hours - if you cannot practice for a chunk of time every day you cannot really learn the language. Such a shame as it used to be brilliant!",1
Amazing,5
I cant get maths😭,5
need free unlimited hearts because it's hard to learn when you have a limit to things. BNR is better try it now if duolingo doesn't update and you are fed up.,2
It was good until a year subscription was made without my warrant and I can't even get a refund,1
amazing app am finally learned to speak polish to my mum who's 🇵🇱polish,5
So fun to learn,5
"I really prefer the old duolingo experience more, also you should really stop that vibration that can't stop when you move to a new leader board.",4
Megusta racha Y aprener Ingles,5
Absolutely wonderful.,5
"Great app, i've learned so much!",5
Great experience so far,5
"PLEASE READ 3 🌟-5🌟. Majority coulda had issue I did DOUBT will CHANGE ifvdorsIl chane. SCHOOL OPTIOM 🇫🇷/ 🇩🇪! ALWAYS wanted 🇪🇸 AND MY 13YO SHE CHOSW 🇪🇸 NXT 2 YRS.

ESP v basic then 🇪🇸 etc. Seems then.- v little time p.d - familiar 2app, the routine on 🇫🇷 routine b same 🇪🇸. Hoping right sayin makes sense so far tried SEVERAL this best!",5
"It really helps me to learn. I am tolerant, but it is strange to see most of the characters in Duolingo are gay",5
honestly best language learning app very good,5
really easy to use,5
I think this app is too good and I'm so happy about that😁👍 and go like this👌😆oh by the way the updates are pretty cool🤟😃🤟,5
"Buggy app, two ads for every single lesson, blatantly wrong lessons, other lessons that don't make any attempt to actually teach anything. Over the course of my 3 year streak there has been a steep decline in quality for both the app and the lessons. Should be 0 stars.",1
good,2
"I hate your leaderboard, it pressure me to chase the xp instead of learning for real. I ended up not going forward with my learning plan and just stuck in gaining points just to climb that leaderboard (by doing the easiest course so i can finish fast and gain more xp). Your leaderboard suck. I lost interest in learning the language i used to love because of it. But I'm gonna stay, renew my subscription and we'll see what you're gonna do next.",2
Excellent 👍🙂,5
"the best app to learn new languages, I love it 💗👏",5

"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ the bestest app ever, my French, is getting better🤭",5

I love doulingo because in this app we can learn so many languages 🤩,5
great,5
amazing!,4
i love this app thank you duolingo now i can finally understand what my grandparents are saying 💓💓😎😘,5
I think duolingo is a very fun app that makes learning new languages fun! I've started learning Español (yeah I know some Spanish now) and im started to get good at it with my 2 day streak. I love how duolingo help you correct your mistakes and adds that to a new lesson to help you remember the answer including how you can practice to earn hearts or use gems instead of having to pay! 5 stars,5
too many ads,1
"I learned so many Japanese word ,tysm😊😊😊",5
lovely!,5
A great learning app my french in school has become so much easier because I'm used to learning new words and pronunciation love the podcast levels overall an amazing app for all ages to learn a bunch more 😃👍,5
Too easy to misread or misclick and you lose hearts :(,4
good for learning languages!,4
It's so cute,5
I like this app. I ask this future from the developer tem. 1. aptitude lessons,4
"it's nice, but can you guys make a software that can search thing like, name, color,e.t.c.",5
it's too good but heart too less only 5 heart they give us please give more heart's atleast add 10 hearts,4
"Great learning app, two stars because It's getting me to speak French. I know I'm saying it right, and it's saying I'm incorrect. All that is doing is making me waste hearts.. it's driving me nuts doing the same old thing. If there's any way this can be fixed, that'd be great. Otherwise, I'm getting marked wrong for being right.",2
The best language teaching apps l've ever come across,5
ممتاز,5
كتير حلوه وا وا وا,5
perfect 🥰,5
"One of the best app, period.",5
good,5
A very good app to learn a new language. I like that they have a platform for corrections.,5
I have never used this app but l think it's a very good teaching app and it teaches people in fun ways and am saying all that because l once did a research about this app in my school and community and it turns out that it's super helpful. Keep up with the good work,5
"It is really good.Focus from the very scratch currently started Spanish, let's see what will happen",4
Great!,5
It's the best platform to use when wanting to learn a new language.,5

"Its perfect,just wish lives would be easier to get",4
it's great,5
it's fun to learn English,5
this app has taken me far,5
awesome,1
Garbage lesson plans. In what world is learning how to order a coffee more important than asking for a bathroom or a telephone. The ordering is atrocious.,3
"your widget as a reminding feature keeps me committed. however, you can consider adding sound features to the widget icon to enhance its reminding feature",5
good my for... ❤❤,4
It's a really cool journey once you make some progress and I like to see the animations when the daily streak expands.,5
حلو اوووي بجد ومفيد ♥♥♥,5

Very nice and useful.,5
it is very important,5

هذا الطتبيق هو مفيد جدا مما فادني في السفر الى إلمانية و اشكر صانع الطتبيق على فكرته المجنون و شكرًا جزيلًا ولكن الشيء الذي جعلني اضع اربعة نجوم هو مدة الثلاثين دقيقة تمر مثل سرعة البرق واتمنّا من الله ان يرزقك على هذا الطتبيق يا صانع ديولينغو,4
Many errors and gliches,1
"moves on to the next section a bit fast, would rather have more lessons repeating words for them to sink in.",3
pretty good,5
very nice,5
vieeeeel zu vieeeeeeel Werbung 🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤗,2
Thank you Duolingo,5
Easy to use and fun to learn,5
nice platform to learn,5
Please add learning for Malayalam speakers also,3
very nice and competent provides enough time for learning,5
Totally amazing music that you can play and the maths but I just ignore the ads (well no proper ads) but still a great learning app my favourite part is the daily reward where you can be very lucky trying to get the super duolingo.,5
I've learnt soo much within such little time,5
"It's really fun, engaging and actually let's you learn a ton for free, if you are a casual learner that is. For paid plan, it must be really good. Duo's changing/emotional icons actually urges me to practice 😃",5
good 😊,5
awesome,5
Perfect place to learn,5
very helpful and fun,5

it's excellent,5
its best learning english,5
"I hate it, you ask me to rate your every time, here's your rating.",1
why it's not free for learn 😕,1
Have considered uninstalling it multiple times. The only thing keeping me hooked is my streak. Loved the idea of learning how to read musical notes but the amount of notes and speed of playing increases way too quickly. It's just frustrating. The threats imposed by the owl are disturbing. I thought this app was supposed to be fun? What even are the pictures at the end of a lesson? They are nothing short of creepy. Guess that fits their strange image. There are way better learning apps out there.,2
it's helpful to learn the any languages and then it is nice one.,5
I'm enjoying learning 4 languages😄 2 in real life 1 by me and 1 FROM DUOLINGO💚🦜,5
I have been learning french with Duolingo for only 2 days and i know so much already! I highly recommend,5
It started my streak,1
Duolingo is so fun not like any language tutorial or whatever you have to give you language lessons this is the best I recommended the most now one day I'll be able to go to Paris thanks to Duolingo I owe it all to them,5
it's very very good app from here I learn English and maths u can also try this app it's very important for basic learning.,5
I like cause it helped me learn many more languages,5
it is realy fun and easy,5
"Duoling is great and is helping me improve my German and I look forward to my daily challenges. The only thing I would say, is that it is American English which at times is slightly different to British English, so I would prefer if they were to adapt it and offer a British English version.",5
its amazing and joyful app for learning english language.I don't get bored at all while learning English in this way. thanks Duolingo keep it up 💯 🥰,5
"at first i felt like i was mot retaining anything. And there is no explaination of the words this, your, is. so by a manner of memorizing the correct answer and spelling ive fained a little traction",5
it help ke learn French and hepl whith my French at school🤩❤,4
انه رائع جدا انصح به,5
The best App👏👏👏,5
"amazing apps, listen and speak English and another language 💫",5

Never thought I could learn a native language this well and this effective. I really do recommend using this app,5
আমি চাই এখানে অ্যাপে এমন একটি ইউনিট রাখা হোক যেখানে আমরা নিজের ধর্ম নিয়ে কথা বলতে পারবো ইংরেজিতে।,5
nice app duolingo Thankyou,5
duo is the best language app I've ever done. I'm even starting irish for my school,5
the app is amaizing it is fun to learn there so if you dont have duolingo you should download it specialy to learn because its just to perfect now i can speak spanish and speak basic conversations in just TWO WEEKS thats crazy if you ask me beacuse i wasnt sure to download it at first but i think they should add some thing that asks you why you missed practice beacuse some people may miss practice beacuse their wifi is not working or they had to go to a family occasion or something like that !!,5
great!..but a lil bit boring..,4
Great app for learn any language,5
seekhne ke liye bahut hi sahi app hai .,5
"Not too bad, a bit pricey, although free option is available if you don't mind ads.",4
"Entertaning and fun app. Quite addictive. It's mainly a game and hardly a way to lear a language, though. I'm doing the Japanese course. There is no theory at all, and sometimes I think it would be very useful. Lessons are quite repetitive too. Especially kanji lessons are always about reviewing the same few kanjis over and over to a point where it becomes too boring. Furthermore, kanji lessons are full of errors and seem to be getting worse with updates.",2
Very accurate for lessons but there is a lot of payment to be successful in leagues (demotions and going to the next league),4
a good designed app for beginner language learners,5
excellent is verry good training,5
excelente! muy práctico para familiarizarse con un idioma,5
duolingi is nice source of English learning,5
"I find that learning more than one language is very important and can be abln incredibly useful skill so when I heard about doulingo I wanted to try it and now I'm completely hooked on it 😄 I have never thought that it would be this easy to learn German but that said, I speak Afrikaans which is a mix of dutch and German so at the moment I'm speak 2 languages and am learning a third 🥉🥉🥉 it's so fun and my friend is actually learning Japanese right now so thank you doulingo! Goodbye! KM",5
sehr gut,5
Very Good Experience ❤👍,5
"You learn and have fun. My child loved it, 😍 5 STARS.",5

I learned how to speak Spanish if you invite a friend on Duolingo then they'll give you free super duolingo,5
hi my name is........ duolingo is the best way to learn any language.,5
"The app used to be a fun way to practice some language skills but it's devolved into a money grabbing scheme. The developers have no integrity, no love of language, they just want your money and they'll use whatever scammy tricks they can to get it out of you. It attempts to punish your mistakes by encouraging you to pay to try again, all this will encourage people to give up. someone put accountants in charge of development which is always a mistake",1
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰,5
bhout badhiya app hai,5
I am not able to sign in to app,1
"📖This learning app Like a game ❤️👍 Every children to parents should study in this Platform 😁👍 You'll be learning very soon⏳🏁 🔥 I think it's Better than scrolling FB ,Insta and YT Video's 🤗 💰👍",5

Back then it was easy to try and learn Spanish but now with this app it's all about money even if you make a mistake I get it you get a heart taken from you but you can't check the words unless you are in advanced mode you should be a lease able to learn from your mistakes not being an advanced mode to learn from your mistakes now with this app is all about money,1

Great love it!,5
nice app,5
"Duolingo Review: Gamified but Superficial Duolingo makes language learning fun but lacks depth. Its gamification tricks users into feeling progress without real mastery. While useful for basic vocabulary, it fails in grammar, conversation, and real-world application. Serious learners should replace it with books, structured lessons, and speaking practice. Duolingo is a time trap, not a path to fluency.",2
good,5

it's just awesome for learning and like a game aslo I am satisfied with this,5

this is a very helpful app,5
"The app is only getting worse. They are focusing on releasing new paid features and the free learning experience is getting worse as time passes. The ads increased, 5 hours to get a heart is insane and most importantly we can no longer do more than one practice lesson, meaning I can only have one heart at a time through practice, obligating me to get the next lesson perfectly",3
"pretty good, I've used it before, and it was okay then, but they've definitely improved! speaking wasn't something I expected, though, but welcome! One thing I'd like is the profile pictures back (importing actual art for your profile) rather than an avatar, as it feels kind of odd. But overall, хороший! the Russian one is nice, but I hope the Gaelic is good because I want to learn my countries language because it's not taught anymore",4
great app,5
make test after every round,4
أنه ممتع جدا ومفيد ايضا انا انصح لتجربته,5
easy to learn many courses with fun 😍❤️,5
"This is a very good app, with this people can learn There will be help",5

"its a good app for learning, i just about this from TikTok",5
It's an amazing app and it really helps me learn Japanese (I would give it four and a half stars if I could but I can't) but there are just loads of ads.,4
only thing is they don't tell what some of the words mean and then you've gotta guess but then it penalises you for not knowing which is a bit daft,4
Nice app,5
wow,5
awesome,4
duolingo is a very fun and knowledgeable app,5
best language learning app for those who don't know it teach us with very interesting and beautiful way I definitely recommend this app,5
This app has helped me with my language,5

Best app for Spanish out there. Love their animations!,5
I'm learning Russian. this app is crazy. just try it for a month. After these 30 days you will be surprised. I promise.,5
This app is good for learning new word,5
"The app is really great for language learning but I'm giving it a two star because of the way it hangs. I recently started using the app and when I went further, if I try playing the games, it won't load or when it gets to those audios I don't hear anything, I don't know if I'm expected to use my imagination and mind you guys I have stable network Please fix this",2
easy learning ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5

amazing app for beginners.,5
"I love it I am learning a lot from it , thank you so much Duolingo",5
The best app,5
"I love this app very much and have studied several languages with it. Though it offers little in grammatical rules, it teaches by example and repetition. I've recommended this to many friends who have expressed an interest in learning a new language. I think of Duolingo as a good introduction, and I always suggest further study elsewhere. Also, when will you offer a stuffed Owlicorn in your shop? Even a little plastic Owlicorn figurine would make me happy, so long as its head can turn.",5

"Love this app, if there's any app that anyone should get hooked to it's Duolingo. Currently on a 1+ year streak and a Super member. I only have one request to the devs regarding UX which I hope they bring is to be able to swipe a missing word into its place in the sentence and also to be able to rearrange words by swiping. This already exists in the iOS version of the app & would be glad if the Android version gets it as well.",5
Ha sir,5
Sooooo cool,5
good,5
I'm getting a lot stronger with my Spanish and can understand some of what I hear in the real world with real speed and sound,5
"I don't just know how to explain how food duo is it's just the best language learning app,it helps you stay motivated on learning your language,and the anticipation of keeping your streak is just fantastic ❤️ tho I would've loved if there was a section for an exam on what you've learnt.i love you so much DUOLINGO 😁😁😁",5
"so far so good, I'm really enjoying this",5
"My Mic is not working for the speaking exercises. Instead it just immediately stops listening when I press the button. I have the app set to allow microphone access when the app is open. Still Doulingo will not gain microphone access. On top of this reaccuring problem, I pay for premium and I still get this new horrible AI tier that should be avaiable for free honestly. I can no longer be told what I'm doing wrong in leasons because Duolingo wants me to pay more for a stupid AI feature.",2

"Their methodology to learn chinese characters defies any logic and is extremely confusing. A multiple characters word is not dissociated from each character unique sound. As a result, when you learn one character, you are being repeated the entire word that the character is part of...which becomes extremely annoying and makes it nearly impossible to try to memorise each character sound... the simple logic would be to learn each character and its sound separetely and then the entire word.",2
your app is very good and perfect,5

very good for Welsh but some phrases are North Wales l need South,3
"The app is good, but English-to-Bengali translation has issues with homographs (words that look the same but have different meanings). For example, 'বাড়ি' can mean both 'house' and 'increase,' which creates confusion. The app should improve context-based translations to avoid such mistakes.",4

"The app itself is great - when it works! This is the 3rd time in 3 months it stuck on the green screen when trying to open. As before, I had to uninstall and reinstall, then when trying to login I get ""An error occurred. Please try later"" msg. I could still log in on laptop (?) to avoid breaking my streak but this isnt as convenient. Last time I eventually managed to get past this error msg by turning off WiFi, but no luck yet this time - I'm still stuck...",3

very good.,5
Duolingo is amazing in every way 😊,4
"The decision to limit the ability to earn hearts has made the free version of the app unusable for me, especially when studying the harder parts of the course which are more challenging and more mistakes arise because of that. In addition Duolingo should work on fixing the bugs that the app has and also improve synchronisation with desktop app. I would have given it 5 stars but the removal of the ability to practise to earn hearts is a deal breaker for me 💔",1

"App works, but I can't complete a lesson because my phone's keyboard doesn't have a letter that is required to spell it (HólÓ<). That last o doesn't appear anywhere online either, or I just can't find it. Still, it's very frustrating knowing I'm softlocked into a lesson I can not complete and therefore can not advance onward.",2
easy way yo learn a new language,5
"I have many of the languages and i know japenese! Some japenese is varun desu gohan to sushi desu( my name is varun,rice and sushi please",5
it's a pretty good app for a while. but it becomes unbearable without buying a super membership because of the adds and minor spelling mistakes will cost you the hearts needed to keep playing. The reason it's 3 stars is because they introduced a max membership on top of the super...It is appalling that I'm supporting this company and they blocked me and others from all the improvements they have made unless I pay double what I'm already paying.,3
It's good app for learning different language,4
it's good but I've only had for two days so this is the initial impression,4

"Best app to learn any language. Very user friendly. Makes us understand each word and analyses our mistakes and makes us to correct them. Best suggested for any user to learn any language. Also has leaderboard and fun quests and badges that encourages us to learn a language. I am a user of Duolingo for 2 years. This app is worth to give a 5 star rating. But the most annoying thing is that each time when you complete a lesson, the ad regarding Super Duolingo pops on the screen. Rest are amazing!!",5

"Duolingo is getting much worse.You used to could earn hearts by practicing and now that option is gone.They are pushing for you to pay for a service that is not good. If they had any kind of customer service, it might be worth it.When users were able to correct each other that was the best way for me to understand. If you make a mistake you can pay for an AI to explain what you did wrong. I don't even use it that often anymore.I used it every day.This was a great app. They got greedy!!!",1

"The ""Practice to earn hearts"" feature has been malfunctioning for the last few months now for me. It works only how it used to, once all the hearts are exhausted and not when say there's four hearts remaining or three or two. Only when I have zero hearts that's when the button work, but as soon as I win the first heart, the button to play again and win more hearts disappears. Since this issue appeared I've updated the app many times, I've reloggd into the app etc. Nothing seems to work.",1

Perfect App! For learning. How is this free guys it's just too awesome. Also follow there insta they post a lot of good stuff.,5
"They offer week-long free trials that lead into a YEAR-long subscription. They'll keep giving them to you, knowing that you'll eventually forget to cancel once and then bam $84 gone, no refunds. Predatory and dishonest imo. Ofc I forgot one time because I'm 🐌 and now I can't stop being salty about it. Then they have the audacity to ask for a review smh.",1

This app is very best for spoken English and any language I suggest all people this app for your career and everything I really appreciate this app thank you Duolingo,5
"With the current gamification system you need at least 30 minutes, but better more. You cannot just do a quick lessen, else you lose all the bonuses. Also, the heart system without paying is extremely bad. I am also not satisfied with getting the same sentences all over again in finished courses review, when the course has many more words and sentences.",3

useful with preference language books (must),5
"Great effort. There are some minor issues at times but no avenue for feedback beyond structured menus that fall short at times. Today, Feb 5th 2025: Sound lost half way through a lesson. This has been happening almost every time after one or two lessons. It also froze, I think while retrieving an add. This too has happened a few times butnot as often as the first issue. Still, a great way to stay connected with a foreign language.",4

"Many learners improved their dedication with the Early Bird/Night Own Chests and doing lessons 2x a day but they took away those and, honestly, it's demotivating to not be able to know how much the platform will change and what will remain or be taken away with new updates. The app has been through majors changes with the many updates that have been happening recently and this last one proves to be the worst one yet.",2

"Duolingo is great and I have enjoyed using it for about 3 years now. But for the past month or two, it hasn't been awarding me all the points I earn for completing lessons, and hasn't been counting all the lessons I have completed. I am not using the free version -- my family and I are paying customers -- so I am very disappointed that Duolingo hasn't been working properly for me for such a long length of time. My family is considering not renewing our subscription because of our frustration.",4

"Update: I'm downgrading my review due to the constant pressure from the game to participate. I work two jobs; excuse me if I don't have time to play round the clock! Ditch this aspect of Duolingo b/c it's quite demotivating. I'm here to learn; not to compete. I play at least a few minutes every day and get high scores, so how am I in the demotion zone?!",2
I love this app😍and also our Duo😄,4

"Новое обновление сломало всю структуру и логику занятий. Теперь ещё и урок, пройдённый без ошибок, получает баллов в два раза меньше, хотя перед занятием обещают другое. Раньше обучение шло от простого к сложному, а теперь в разноброд. Нормальные объяснения пропали. Так ещё и переводить стали неправильно. Написано they (они) переводят как её. Have (иметь) переводят как кушать. Причём не всегда и не везде. Убрали возможность ввода с клавиатуры. В общем испортили предложение. Учиться невозможно.",1

"This app has gone downhill since I got it two years ago. They lock free features behind a paywall and push AI powered subscriptions onto you. And for an app that ""uses ads to fund their teaching,"" they sure do love not teaching with how many times a right answer wasn't accepted and with giving users random words they haven't even been taught yet. It's good for starting a language and that's it. Don't even try the music lessons unless you want to get pissed.",2
perfetto,5
"I really liked Duo, but now I am constantly being peppered with ads for Duo Max. It sucks. I pay to not have ads, but now every time you make a mistake you're given an ad.

But when I can't get a box because you don't have an ad available... So you decided to make the game playable only when it's convenient to you for me to watch ads. To make matters worse, I just watched an ad through, but got nothing for it. Fix your ad system or get rid of it.",1

"My wife and I have been using this app for over a year now. We're pretty disappointed with the competitive atmosphere they force you to participate in. They make you feel like you aren't doing enough if you're not grinding dozens of lessons. The designers of this app have their priorities backwards. You can't turn off leagues in the app, and if you discover how to go 'private', you lose other features like the ability to cooperate with family and friends. I will not be renewing my pro plan.",2

very nice app for learning the English,5
"it's so cool that it teaches me to speak Korean,Japanese,Chinese,Spanish,french, Germany,Indonesian,Malaysian,",5
so beautiful game 💞💞💞,5
it's a good game but the first few times u try they give u a free refill on gems but when u don't have enough gems u can't buy hearts and have to try either later or the next day that's all,3
the best and the finest perfect for all age's I have the family plan,5
goated,5
this game is very dirty,1
really help me to understand another language. Grazie!,5
Great app for learning phrases but would love to see an update where we can use Duo offline since some people's WiFi(including mine) is really bad and cuts off,5
very good,5
"they let you regain your hearts, and it helps really good if you need it to be slow, and takes time, and let's you speak, and make sure you do your goals!",4
It just helps people to learn with simple lessons and really fast. Just love it.,5
"This is the best way to learn a language, very good for traveling purposes.",5
I've always hated learning new languages but now it's the highlight of my day.,5
"I am still using Duolingo to learn French, and I love it because I can use it anywhere I am whenever I have some free time",5
it's fun and good,4
"The app is an extremely helpful app and makes a MASSIVE difference in understanding, and LOW key has a thing that helps you with math so that your knowledge doesn't TAPER and FADE",5
Excelentes alternativas de apoyo y aprendizaje.,5
it's a great app. easy to use and comprehend. it doesn't get boring.,5
best,5
amazing!!,5
No option to repeat previous lessons.,3
Please add arabic language for bangla/ Bengali users and all users,5
Great. For my kids to learn.,5
"Great app, consistent use definitely builds your confidence and really pushes you to keep on going.",5
Its actually pretty good i can learn basic sentences in Spanish,5
this game is very nice and we can learn all languages and music also and something any other now see I have written this message in english ❤️❤️❤️,5
nice,5
So far I have been very pleased with the results.,5
very good,5
Duolingo is an INCREDIBLE app and it is great if you want to learn many languages. Also it's also a very fun way to learn and to enjoy. But you also have a limit of mistakes you can make like you'll have five hearts and every time you make a mistake you lose a heart and when you lose all of your hearts you have to wait a few hours and then you will automatically get five new hearts or you could just do a practice round to earn hearts!!!! either way is still great!!👍 I TOTALLY recommend this app,4
I love this app like boo bable,5
Great for learning Deutsch and Русский,5
"I love this app. It's fantastic. There's just one thing that grates on my nerves. Duolingo, if you're out there: Harvard is spelled with two Rs, not one!",5
wow it is so good,5
amazing for a free app,5
My whole family on it now. that says a lot.,5
"Haven't seen my cousin in a while, ever since he used this app. Any update, please and thank you. - Hudson Bay ""Hudson Bay Marshall's"" Marshall",3
It is great to learn now languages. I am learning Japanese.,5
really fun,5
"Amazing service, my streak glitched, and they fixed it within a day. It must've been an error in the servers thanks duo team",5
A great way to make learning a new language fun!,5
nice place to learn your favorite language,5
It's a really good app for learning languages but I wanna see my class leaderboard on android because it's not fair that ios get it but android doesn't I would like to see that fixed in a future update please,4
it is educational and fun,5
I really like it because it helps me to learn different languages in case I go to a different country,5
"I've said it before and I will say it again, STOP PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR THEIR MISTAKES!!!! MAKING MISTAKES IS A NATURAL PART OF LEARNING!!!! Your learning model really needs changing! I don't understand why you refuse to listen to your users over and over again. Truly terrible.",1
that's good i learned Spanish a bit little ☺️🎀,5
very surprising,5
the best one.,5
"The app really does well what it's supposed to do, learning is personal thing and it still depends on the person a lot but for me, as for someone who never liked to learn things by head, this app works wonderful and I can feel the impact of lessons over time and that is learning the language from the scratch. Even if it will vary from person to person, I advice giving it a try at least and to keep in mind the repetition does matters, so do notification reminders.",5
pretty fun. hopefully it'll help me speak in spain,5
"it is very educational to all kids and tells you your speed and accuracy, duolingo also re do the mistakes you did.👍👍👍😁",5
Duolingo is a great app for real,5
"Okay, here's the deal, if you want to learn a language, go to another site like bable. This is a decent program but not comparatively . And one more thing that you will want to know!! If you allow notifications it sends you hundreds. And it gets better, I stopped doing for a day or 2 it started pinging me nonstop. And guess what it said?""Your French is moldy🤢🤮"" you believe it said that!? That is only kne of the insane amount of rude comments. The comments continue even after I deleted the app",1
Subscription is the way to go if you want to practice alot,5
Love the little characters. I love that you can just type in answers by using can't speak now.,5
its really helpfull its like studying but with playing i feel really fun study with duolingo,5
I am having a wonderful time learning Japanese,5
Enjoy the learning process,5
This makes learning a language fun. Over time it becomes subconcious.,5
very good,5
really fun learning Italian!,5
I love this app great wide range of languages,5
I just looked on the app and it said that how I have a freeze for yesterday but I did a lesson yesterday so why didn't it register?,5
I love Duolingo- it's so fun and makes learning new languages so rewarding!,5
"I love Duolingo bc it helps you learn different languages if you want to and,there is also a app called duo abc!",5
has improved greatly over the years,5
Thank you Duolingo 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚,5
"I'm finally fed up with all the mistakes in the French course. I only see more of them over time, so clearly it's not going to be fixed.",2
"simple, works good, and now I can speak Japanese. I recommend duolingo if you want to learn a language or practice math or music. and haveing a Streak helps with practiceing every day.",5
my dad likes it,5
I've been enjoying learning French through Duolingo but there's no Tagalog.,3
very nice 👍,5
tiktok was banned so I downloaded this for the luls to spite america...now several weeks in...im still speaking chinese...and doing rather well at it. everything is just the right size for me not to chuck the phone in the wall when I've tried to learn on other platforms. thanks owl man. I promise not to break our streak *I like my fingers,5
I think it's amazing even though I just started Italian I love it and the ways it make you comprehend how to understand it is perfect I wish I could do 100 stars how good it is SUBSCRIBE TO DUO'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL I LIKE THAT TOO!!!,5
I like it so much 😍😍❤️😍😍❤️😍😍❤️😍😍😍❤️😍❤️😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️,5
Fun,5
"Amazing, a quick way to learn",5
"I Love it, definitely should download ❤️❤️",5
Beautiful for learning but the maths is to easy,5
Wajib bgt download untuk mengasah kemampuan bahasa Inggris mulai dari dasar nyaaaa,5
it gives me improvement of learning nee languages,5
It's addictive and fun. It also makes me want to keep on improving.,4
very good,5
it really helped me learn what are languages that I thought would be hard for me,5
greatttt,5
one of the best,5
very easy tool to learn,5
"learning Chinese for Redbook, learning new culture and their language and writing bc the world doesn't revolve around the US. always good to continue learning and growing",5
"Duolingo is a perfectly decent language learning app, but I genuinely can't believe how much it's ruined itself or changed in service to a paid model and now AI. Lessons constantly change and the added information is functionally useless since it no longer gives you crucial grammar and structural information (I imagine they moved it to the ""AI powered"" Explain My Mistake.) It's good to start, or for daily refreshers, but this app has GENUINELY fallen a long way.",1
"I have learned a lot of words and phrases. However, I still can not hold a conversation after 3 years of practice.(french) I have paid for the plus. However, the new features are not included. Duolingo wants even more money to access the new features. Definitely considering switching platforms.",2
Perfect.,5
very nice,5
best application for learning languages,5
"excruciatingly annoying cartoon transitions between lessons. voice recognition isn't great. Spanish is ok but very slow going, french has the worst impression of a french accent making it quite hard to understand if you're used to hearing real french people.",2
great to learn french but has a bit of problems,4
I'm learning Spanish yaaay!,4
"I have finished more than 1000 words in 6 months but I am only at Level 22, there are people in just two months and with only 200 words they have reached Level 24!",1
amazing 🤩 anyone can do this kids and adults it helps so much you just never want to end it after you started it's not too hard so try it out!!!😁😃,5
this is a very good app and I love it and especially duo it is very helpful for learning a new language,5
I love ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 the APP LOVE LOVE,5
nice 👍,5
Just Love it 🥰 been there for more than 2 years.. Appreciated their work and efforts for peeps around the world.,5
"Ihan ok. Nyt vaan ""sydämiä"" ei enää saa takaisin harjottelemalla.",2
When I talk to it the app do not lesson to me and i get it wrong. So I hate it,3
very good app for kids trying to learn different languages the only thing I would change is being able to have more than 2 courses at a time other than that a really good app,4
"Caution DO NOT enroll in any free trial offers for Super Duolingo, or Duolingo Max. They indicated that they would notify me before the end of the trial period, so I could cancel at no charge and then DID NOT notify me. There is no way to request a refund directly. Don't risk your money. NEVER enroll in a trial for a paid subscription with Duolingo. Stick with the free service only, or better yet, use one of the many alternatives.",1
bazi derslerinde hatalar var. sacma cumleler kurdurabiliyor. rusca dersinde cogullar kisminda bir yanlislik var. su an ki deneyimlerimle bunlari soyleyebilirim.,4
good,5
"liking it so far. 16 day streak and I already know loads of basic sentences. it takes about 10/15 minutes a day minimum, but you can do as much as you want. I normally do around half an hour. treat it like a game.",5
This app is good for learning languages and also expanding your vocabulary more creatively.,5
great,2
Using this app has really helped me communicate better with languages I'm not familiar with. It even reminds me to take lessons. 5 stars 🤩,5
"works exelent for casual and more heavy use, it teaches very well and lets you go at your own pace. It does a very good job to make sure you sre learning and dont quit. I tried both free and non free and i can say both work good.I learned very well in this app!!!",5
absolutely recommend if you are struggling with a new language or school work,5
it's very fun sowaar,4
There are tons of different languages to learn. The training is worth it it teaches you basic steps and works it way up to challenging steps in learning any languages. The tools it offers are good and simple to use and learn each words and there meanings. You can set up your calendar on days of training. Get achievements for completing each training.,4
great for daily language exercises,5
very nice it is like a fun game and also educating,5
nice app to learn languages,4
perfecto Duolingo ❤️❤️,5
Great app for learning English.,5
"My own device never offers me spoken lessons, when I try use the spoken targeted practice, it says ""you need to have your microphone turned on for this feature"" yet it is on. I redownload it constantly. It just will not ever present me spoken lessons. Also the fact alone that you don't even auto reply to anyone's reviews would cost you a couple stars from me.",1
"It could be much better. The app seems like it has transitioned from a ""learn a language"" app to a ""hi buy this and then ill give you 10% less ads."" If you want to opt out of ads then set your account to a child account, the most you'll get is a premium ad instead. Oh and can I mention the fact that I said specifically ""don't email me"" and then I unsubscribed from their email list, they still sent me emails? Pretty sure that's illegal. And the devs are not updating the app as well! Gamefied bs.",2
I love this,5
"helps more with learning words, phrases and alphabets, this plus immersion works wonders. at least with japanese",4
The new levels of demotion zones intend to encourage people to do more lessons. They actually very demoralizing as it's not a healthy competition. I'm actually doing less now,1
It helps you learn your language or any Kind you want to learn My favorite game on my tablet,5
"fun, easy to use, and is definitely worth it",5
"Pretty fun, and they have a great marketing team. Also need to keep up my streak for another 100 days to get my parents back. wish me luck.",5
Great app for learning language!,5
muito bom!!,5
I really think duolingo is a great impact on me I've been able to learn some Spanish sentences,5
"Tthis is my current experience but i had like 2 of those streak freezes thing, but when i woke up i literally lost my streak when i equipped the streak freezes.",4
B E S T,5
you're the best 😻,5
"I've used Duolingo for over a year now, and I've barely learnt anything! 😡. I see very little improvements, I would really not recommend this. The majority of what you learn here is just words, it was an ABSOLUTE WASTE of TIME. If you want to learn a language and take AGES to learn it, and waste time, yeah, sure, go here. But for fast/regular speed learning then NO. don't waste your time here. 👎",1
this Is amazing! helps kids with math too!,5
engaging. Vietnamese language can still be difficult to learn for newbs. doesn't teach you the accents. ads are enjoying.,4
thank u,5
i like the game and how it teaches us a lot,5
"What will I say about Duolingo? I can't explain the facilities or advantages just with my words. I just wanna say that it will make life easier, more beautiful by giving the opportunity to learn languages all over the world. Just awesome!!!",5
"it's just perfect, thank you soooo much",5
"used to love it. I pay for super and they have taken away the practice sessions that were one of the reasons I chose to pay. A big ad for Max has taken the place of the practice session. Super is supposed to be ad free, but they keep shoving Lily. False advertising.",2
Very nice app no doubt at all 😊,5
❤️❤️🌺,5
very wonderful and pretty effective,5
VERY GOOD FUN,5
Wow this app is very luxury to me,4
fantastic app for learning,5
very good daily practice,5
very nice,5
"Fun way to learn a new language, although the speech bot needs some work, way too many times to I hear ""ri"" instead of ""ni"" with the letter に, or the with something like ひふ, instead of hearing ""hifu"" it's ""hihu"" but separate, the letters sound fine",4
I love this app. It's gonna help learn spanish for my dad😄,5
best app,5
good and great!,5
I think it's a very good way to learn different languages ☺️,5
Speaking exercises not working. Some tests are so hard that native speakers are not able to pass it. Bugs like potion with a duration of less that 3 minutes instead of 15.,1
"I have been trying to learn Spanish for a few days now with Duolingo, and I am really enjoying the app. It's fun and easy to follow. I highly recommend.",5
"Its ok, not great at teaching grammar or pronunciation for Chinese. I would also like to see a ""stop listening"" button because speaking tasks pick up any and all background noise and I spend ages waiting for it to tell me I got it wrong",4
so good learning Chinese 😊,5
The mascot was shouting at me.Thats why I put 1 star otherwise I don't really like the new game ranked in duolingo,1
Best app,5
"I don't really like the fact that if you don't get among the first 3, you get demoted. At least give them one more chance. And I also don't like the nudging because sometimes it sounds hurtful and might disencourage the person you nudged to do a lesson. But overall, good app",4
Duo really motivate me to learn a new language😍,5
it's a great way to learn languages 👍,5
awesome 👌,5
"I've been a Duolingo fan since they started! Though as someone who wants to get everything out of learning Latin as I can, I'm disappointed it's not as updated as the other languages or at least has speaking exercises. I believe most languages are missing speaking exercises, actually. No technical issues so far that keep me from using the app.",4
I love this app it is so useful 👍😍I like ow it real in details which makes it easy for beginners,5
sangat membantu dalam belajar bahasa asing Dan mudah,5
nice 👍,5
Amazing tool to learn I have more than 70 days streak but sometimes it's boring sometimes however overall it's great. I do Spanish :). There barely any ads only very few,4
"Be careful when starting and trying to cancel any trials, they don't make it easy. The Spanish on Google is very different if looking for support.",3
"Learning this foe 2 years, held a 280 day streak and now I'm pro at german now",5
amazing,5
The best app for learning i appriciate it,5
it is soooo fun it can be hard but Duolingo is great for learning a new language,5
لقد خسرت اكتر كن 208 يوم لاني كنت مريض طريح الفراش هادا لايس عادل ساترك تطبيقكم فهادا لا يشجع ابدا كل من اعرف حدفو التطبيق بسبب دالك المرجو وضع حل او شي من هاد القبيل هناك من مريض و هناك من انكسر له هاتفه وهناك من لا يملك انترنت هادا ضلم 😠😠😢,1
Perfect application,5
I think that it's easy and I love that if a can't speak are leisson I can move on to the net lesson,5
"awsome learning app for kids,adults,elders",5
"Ich finde die App wirklich super. Man muss nicht unbedingt eine Mitgliedschaft kaufen, aber dafür Werbung in Kauf nehmen, was auch völlig in Ordnung geht. Die einzige Sache die ich mir wünschen würde ist ein Kurs für Tagalog.",4
good exercises to learn a difficult language to master,4
i loved being able to learn so fast and easy it has been a great app,5
AMAZING I love it,5
It's good for students to learn👍,5
like it but not the games. unnecessary,4
you're the best,5
Werbung nervt ein wenig sonnst👍,4
"Used to be fine, but they've started accepting really scammy companies to do ads. Really misleading interfaces to close or skip the ads, etc. I'll update the rating if the ads change.",1
nice,5
"I've been experiencing the same issue for over two months – I only get the daily refresh and no new lessons. It's frustrating, and it's impacting my experience with the app. At this point, I'm really disappointed and won't be paying for the service again",1
awesome app. love it!,5
A super fun effective way to learn a new language.,5
"This game is amazing! It's educational, fun and cute. Easy to learn step-by-step learning and for free! 🤩💚",5
Very engaging and scorched I'm enjoying learning Chinese so quickly!,5

It's haven't Persian language...💔,1
Chat no MAX some e não é possível terminar lição,2
👍👍👍😊 I am very co mfortable,5
I love this program!,5
good,5
I like how it persistently reminds me of my lessons everyday. Sometimes I forget 🤭🤭. Though they don't do much teaching. it's more of a self learn exercise thing.,4
I love having something to learn so I can talk to new people in new places 😉,5
Solid it's good,5
I think duolingo is good for learn a new language uhm it's fine for me ❤ whh i think i don't need superduolingo,5

"very interesting, educating and fun",5

It is such an amazing learning app that helps you understand and know better the new/foreign language with baby steps each day and it's so fun to indulge in the lessons.,4

Best Of Best,5
good 👍,5
"so far,I think that Duolingo is a great learning app,I'm currently learning Portuguese and Espanol to help me in school and it's helping very much .I do recommend 😊",5
"- No any reactions for mistakes, why do you even add this functionality? - No any support for email requests - Very noisy ""next level super AI plan"". I've already have ""super plan"". these constant ads make me feel less important as a ""premium user"" who pays money for the application. - approximately 50% of all the boosts after daily quests disappear every day. Today, all 3 boosts include x3 for tomorrow's disappear. + Still the best game application for studying foreign languages.",2
I'm not sure what's going on it says I'm out of hears when I actually have three left and would not let me continue,2
Duolingo is the best app for learning languages,5
this application is very good I liked because we can learn the world languages,5
The best language learning Tool that i know. This app is produced at another level by a huge team of experts.,5

great,5
what a great app !!,4
it's amazing,5
"Gets worse with newest updates. I use to love to practice to earn hearts button and it allowed you turn earn 5 hearts. Unfortunately, that option disappeared. it's not really useful for anything except learning to read or possibly write Spanish. Disappointed that after the 2024 update can no longer practice to earn 5 hearts so it's useless if you cannot practice.",1
excellent app,5
It helps me a lot to save words in my brain,5
I'm learning Italian it's going a little slow but I don't care,4
duolingo realy helped me learn a lot of german and Korean (I even learned English a lil better thanks to duolingo! best learning app ever!,5
تطبيق رائع جدآ و مفيد لدرجة كبيرة جدا لقد احببته 😘,5
"Pretty cool and funny so far, I'm learning Spanish",4
"I'm enjoying it so far, stuff is made decently easy to learn and at no cost. thank you duolingo",5
You can learn new language and lean maths and songs,5
This app is very great 👍,5
THE APP IS NICEEEE,5
"Estou amando muito. Para quem não tem muito tempo durante o dia, é perfeito. Eu tiro ao menos 10 minutos por dia para fazer lições que são divertidas ainda por cima. Super recomendo ☺️",5

"I am currently learning Korean, so far, so good and I enjoy the reminders you put to keep me up",4
i love it,5
it helped me learn russian.what else should I say.i hope I'm safe from duo.,5
I gave 4 stars as it has become a limited app if you dont purchase its subcription. It used to make you watch ads in exchange for free contents such as practice lessons and stories. Now you have to watch ads and still have to 'pay' 100 gems to access each practice lesson.,4
excellent,5
I'm learning Irish and it is going very well,4
it helps me a lot,5
i love the app and learn much from it,5
it’s very good Professional Development idea apps,5
είναι τελειο,1
"Duolingo is the best, thank you so much for making my English language even better, Duolingo",5
SUPER,5
Helpful and fun way to learn a language,5
I chose to uninstall the app because its content and messaging did not align with my personal values. I encourage others to evaluate the app's content carefully to determine if it aligns with their own beliefs and principles,1
Not very suitable as a sole learning source but is Allright if used to help understand the language a little further. You just start out learning very limited vocabulary with no way to learn more without going through more lessons that teach the same words. Please give me my family back.,3
very good app,5
amezing app,5
This app is really helpful,5
too good,5
nice i liked thiss app,5
"I learn very well and quickly , thank you too much 🤍",5
It is amazing!,4
"I'm sorry but I can't connect to the play store. It's a good one for starters, and it really helpful for who learn new languages.",1
super Duolingo,5
I like duolingo because it's a but confusing at first if your new to a language but it gets easier when you learn words off by heart♥️,5
an amazing app,5
Perfect,5
I love German,5
it's excellent 👌 app,5
outstanding app,5
Brilliant app for learning languages.,5
I like it but I doesn't like the ads but also I can't pay the monthly bills,4
I don't like the fact that they're mainly using translation. There should be more pictures and immersive exercises.,2
"Good for popular languages like German, English, Spanish, but garbage for the rest (like italian for example)",2
cool,5
love learning with this app,5
thanks Duolingo,5
It's a very good app for learn language speaking,5
good,5
I really like this its helping me keep my grade in German up to,5
good very nice super i love you company,5
"Great app!! It is rlly fun, motivate and many more! I think I saw that u can now learn music and math!! I'm learning French at the moment,and I'm excellent at it thanks to Duo! If u wanna learn math,music,or any language,Duo's definitely the best app!",5
It is reaaly good no ads and it is really good and it tells all the langues so have fun😇😇🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤💝,5
I would like to study for test such as IELTS here with a paid plan but exceptional content,5
"Too many ads and limited hearts are the reasons why I took a star away, other than that it is absolutely perfect.",4
I am really grateful to the team who made this app because it helped me improve and learn languages I have never expected I could learn ... And you can learn any language you want ..I adore this app,5
I can't explain how helpful Duolingo is for the beginners or for the kids. It's really interesting and effective to learn a language with fun activities. I love it !,5
Makes learning fun,5
Nice,5
Great app,5
best app,5
I love it so far. the different methods of learning are fab,5
"Good for learning the rhythms of a language and to get your ear in, but look elsewhere to learn the grammatical underpinnings",5
Best app for learning language,5
l was not sure l could say or read Japanese but now through this game l can say and identify,5
best,5
really good for learning Spanish,5
very addictive in a good way.,5
good,2
"UPDATED REVIEW Since they updated the app, I absolutely despise it. It is no longer easy or fun to learn with, it's now very confusing and frustrating. Most features that used to be on the free version are now only accessible with the paid version. If you make 5 mistakes during a lesson, you have to wait 24 hours to replenish your ""hearts"" to try again. I'm currently looking for a better app and then I'll be deleting this. Don't bother wasting your time, this app sucks! 👎",1
"Probé su plan super de 7 días gratis. Sin embargo, al pasar este periodo, no me percaté de la notificación que hacen antes de que caduque el tiempo, por ende, me cobraron su plan de 12 meses sin yo querer, pues no me queda tiempo para usar continuamente esta App y solo la usaba como un complemento. En vez de cobrar por un mes no entiendo por qué cobran por un año, ¿ahora quien me reembolsa? ¡Deberían notificar no solo una vez si nó varias veces o especificar mejor el tipo de cobro!.",1
It's really helpful! you just need to practice it and actually be committed to do it! 😅,5
i love it,5
I thought this is a linguistic app. We give these to our children to improve their linguistics. So it would be great if you avoid courses like music which makes this app another game for our children to get distracted.,1
It's amazing and very helpful Aap,5
The change for free to play players is unacceptable. Newcomers let me explain - You have five hearts that you spend to do lessons. When you make a mistake you lose a heart. Lose all your hearts you must retake the lesson. Previously you could take review courses to get hearts back to full. Great feature. Struggling? Go practice and come back full. Now practice caps you at 1 heart so you get one chance then if you mess up you fail the current lesson. It discourages F2P to push paid. Bad.,1
I really enjoy practicing and improving my Spanish more than scrolling social media,5
very helpful in learning languages Spanish Korean and English. love this app. I only knew two languages in the start. now I know 5,5
nice,5
"The times practices through the units are way too hard to be able to do within the given time. It's just a tactic to force us to get time boosts. I was trying to get them all done, but now it's just become impossible to do even the first level within the given time. The rest is good, but the timed practices are pointless as I don't feel like I'm learning at all since it just stresses me out.",2
Help I Skip My Lessons And Doulingo Kidnapped Me 😭,5
nice👍,5
"sign up, profile, is confusing",3
Duo gives us motivation and excitement and funny faces to keep us motivated ☺️ Duolingo is the best and should be the only language learning app according to me .... No mistakes just pure perfection 😉,5
I like to learn it,5

Amazing,5
Great im irish it really helps with speaking it!!,5
"I like the app because of its game-like features and it is easy to get daily practice. However, I think the word matching exercises are not challenging at all and way too repetitious with even the simplest vocabulary. I'd like to see it include more vocab variety to help expand my knowledge. I know repetition is good for older learners, but how many times do I have to prove I know words like ligero, escuela, and salsa?",4
The best,5
